# Public Repos And Distribution Surfaces

memi v2 needs public proof repos, not only package claims. Use this file to keep npm, GitHub, MCP, Agent Skills, Codex plugin, and example repos aligned.

## Primary repos

| Repo | Role | Public promise |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`sarveshsea/memi`](https://github.com/sarveshsea/memi) | Engine, CLI, MCP server, Agent Skills, Codex plugin, examples, release gates | Interface understanding for AI coding agents. |
| [`sarveshsea/design-sandbox`](https://github.com/sarveshsea/design-sandbox) | Proof workspace | memi-ready Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn, MCP, and Agent Skills sandbox for design-to-code exploration. |
| [`sarveshsea/memi-studio`](https://github.com/sarveshsea/memi-studio) | macOS workbench | Supervised Codex and Claude Code runs with project memory, receipts, artifacts, and Figma/FigJam handoff. |
| [`sarveshsea/memoire-agent-skills`](https://github.com/sarveshsea/memoire-agent-skills) | Skill mirror | Mirror-ready Hermes/OpenClaw skill packages generated from the npm engine. |
| [`sarveshsea/design-skills`](https://github.com/sarveshsea/design-skills) | Design Skills and Community Notes | Mémoire's complete design-skill corpus plus licensed, attributed adaptations for Agent Skills and the Notes marketplace. |

## Proof commands

For `sarveshsea/memi`:

```bash
npm i -g @memi-design/cli
memi diagnose
memi ux audit --json
memi craft audit --json
memi tokens --from ./src --report
memi shadcn export --out public/r
memi agent install universal --project .
memi mcp start --no-figma
```

For `sarveshsea/design-sandbox`:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm memi:agent
pnpm memi:diagnose
pnpm memi:ux
pnpm memi:tokens
pnpm verify
```

## Architecture and cost positioning

- Start code-first; Figma is optional.
- Keep MCP local by default with `memi mcp start --no-figma`.
- Keep first-run proof free of model calls: diagnosis, UX audit, token extraction, registry export, and no-hex checks can run locally.
- Treat agent model usage, Figma API calls, browser automation, video generation, and extra packages as explicit upgrades.
- Use `memi agent install --dry-run --json` before writing skill or MCP files in public repos.

## Compatibility package story

| Surface | Package or file | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| npm | `@memi-design/cli` | Main install and binary. |
| MCP | `server.json` + `memi mcp start --no-figma` | Registry-safe design tools. |
| Agent Skills | `skills/memoire-design-tooling/SKILL.md` | Standard skill ecosystem install. |
| Codex plugin | `plugins/memoire` | `/plugins` install path and MCP wiring. |
| Hermes/OpenClaw | `agent-kits/mirror` | Mirror-ready skill packages. |
| Design sandbox | `.agents/skills`, `.mcp.json`, `memoire.agent.yaml` | Public repo that proves integration. |
| Community Notes | `notes/<note-name>/note.json` | Reviewed downloadable Notes catalog at `/notes/community/catalog.v1.json`. |

## Next public repo targets

Add memi proof links where they are natural and honest:

- Design-system starter repos that already use shadcn/Tailwind.
- Internal-tool templates.
- AI chat UI templates.
- Dashboard/admin templates.
- Product-design agent examples.
- MCP client examples.
- Agent Skills directories.

Do not spam unrelated repos. Each link should include a runnable command and a reason memi improves the local design workflow.

## 10x seeding queue

Start with surfaces we control, then move outward only when the target accepts installable tools, registries, MCP servers, skills, or templates.

| Priority | Surface | Action | Proof to include |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | `memoire.cv` | Keep docs, changelog, footer, downloads, and `/notes/community/catalog.v1.json` synchronized with npm and Studio. | `npm run check:public-release` |
| P0 | `sarveshsea/design-sandbox` | Refresh the sandbox so it proves the 2.3 mandate loop, not only older diagnose/token commands. | `pnpm memi:agent && pnpm verify` |
| P0 | `sarveshsea/memoire-community-notes` | Keep the five starter Notes published and linked from the website catalog. | `npm run check:community-notes && npm run build:community-notes-catalog` |
| P1 | MCP Registry and MCP directories | Submit or refresh `io.github.sarveshsea/memi` as the local design-system MCP server for coding agents. | `memi mcp start --no-figma` |
| P1 | Agent Skills directories | Submit `memoire-design-tooling` as the design-system memory skill for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenCode. | `npx skills add sarveshsea/memi --skill memoire-design-tooling` |
| P1 | shadcn registry directories | Add memi as a registry-quality and design-audit companion for GitHub registries. | `memi shadcn export --out public/r` |
| P2 | AI UI templates | Add memi to templates that already ship Tailwind/shadcn agent interfaces. | `memi craft audit --json` |
| P2 | Dashboard/admin templates | Add memi as a CI design gate where token drift and visual regressions matter. | `memi ci` |
| P2 | Product-design agent examples | Add memi Studio plus CLI proof for project memory, receipts, and Figma/FigJam handoff. | `memi report --badge` |

Good external candidates are directories and repos already organized around these categories:

- MCP Registry and community MCP server directories.
- shadcn open registry index and registry-template examples.
- Agent Skills directories and `npx skills` ecosystem repos.
- Awesome shadcn, AI UI, dashboard, and agent UI template lists.

Each submission should include one sentence of positioning, one install command, one proof command, and one link to a public artifact. If that cannot be done, skip the target.
