# Starstruck And Distribution Plan

Goal: keep GitHub growth tied to useful memi distribution. The base Starstruck tier is now crossed: `sarveshsea/memi` had `17` stars on 2026-07-08. The next honest target is sustained npm activation, then the `128` star tier.

## Current Reality

| Surface | Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub stars | `17` | Starstruck base tier crossed; next visible tier is `128` |
| GitHub description | Updated | `Interface understanding and design-system memory for AI coding agents.` |
| npm release target | `2.4.0` | Local release candidate; npm latest remains `2.3.1` until publish |
| npm downloads | `783` weekly, `1,306` monthly | Latest complete npm windows ending 2026-07-05 |
| 10x npm checkpoint | `7,830` weekly, `13,060` monthly | First growth target from the 2026-07-08 baseline |
| Official MCP Registry | Ready for 2.4.0 refresh | Publish after npm latest is `2.4.0`; current live registry is `2.3.1` |
| `memoire.cv` | Ready for 2.4.0 sync | Public release gate should pass after npm publish and web deploy |
| Open shadcn PRs | `1` | `bytefer/awesome-shadcn-ui#18`; `birobirobiro/awesome-shadcn-ui#493` merged |
| Open MCP PRs | `3` | TensorBlock, YuzeHao2023, and MobinX remain open; toolsdk merged |

## Star CTA

Use one ask everywhere:

```text
If this saves you from rebuilding the same shadcn/Tailwind system again, star the repo so more frontend teams can find it:
https://github.com/sarveshsea/memi
```

Do not ask for fake stars, star swaps, or bot engagement. The ask must sit after a demo, install command, or useful directory submission.

## First Move: Seed Proof Repos

After npm publish and MCP Registry refresh, use `io.github.sarveshsea/memi@2.4.0` as the trust link for directory refreshes and proof repos.

Recheck before directory follow-up:

```bash
curl "https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=io.github.sarveshsea/memi"
```

Why this matters: the official registry is a trust anchor for downstream MCP directories and aggregators. Submit or refresh every MCP directory with the same npm/GitHub links.

## Launch Sequence For 10x Downloads

1. Submit or refresh MCP.Directory, Glama, Smithery, PulseMCP, and mcp.so with the same v2 copy.
2. Refresh `sarveshsea/design-sandbox` so `pnpm verify` proves memi agent install, diagnose, UX audit, token extraction, and shadcn registry output.
3. Follow up on open PRs only with new proof: official registry link, security hardening, demo video, or maintainer-requested fixes.
4. Ship one 60-second terminal demo: install, `memi diagnose`, `memi ux audit --json`, `memi shadcn export`, `memi mcp start --no-figma`.
5. Post the demo to X, Show HN, `r/mcp`, and `r/shadcn` with the GitHub star CTA.
6. Recheck npm downloads and stars weekly in `docs/METRICS.md`.

## Demo Script

```bash
npm i -g @memi-design/cli
memi diagnose --no-write
memi ux audit --json
memi tokens --from ./src --report
memi shadcn export --out public/r
memi mcp start --no-figma
```

Narrative:

```text
Most AI UI tools help create the first draft. memi is for the app after that: diagnose the messy shadcn/Tailwind codebase, extract the token system, export a shadcn-native registry, and give Claude Code/Cursor/Codex the same design-system context through MCP.
```

## Follow-Up Rules

- Follow up on a PR only when there is new proof: official registry URL, npm patch, demo video, or CI fix.
- Do not ping maintainers repeatedly for achievements.
- Do not submit to broad design lists until the public website and registry examples are healthy.
- If a directory rejects memi as too broad, narrow the listing to the MCP server or shadcn registry export workflow.
