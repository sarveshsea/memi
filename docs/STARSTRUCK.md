# Starstruck Distribution Plan

Goal: move `sarveshsea/memi` from `7` real stars to the Starstruck base tier at `16` stars. We need `9` legitimate stars from developers who see enough value to install, test, or bookmark Memoire.

## Current Reality

| Surface | Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub stars | `7` | Need `9` more for Starstruck |
| npm latest | `0.14.3` | Published with `mcpName`; next trust patch is `0.14.4` |
| Official MCP Registry | Not listed | `registry.modelcontextprotocol.io` search returns no Memoire result |
| Glama | Listed | Listed as `sarveshsea/memi`, but the description still reflects the older design-system MCP positioning |
| GitHub topics | Updated | Strong enough for search: `mcp-server`, `shadcn-native`, `shadcn-registry-generator`, `design-ci`, `token-extraction` |
| SafeSkill PR | Open, blocked badge | Do not merge until score improves or findings are addressed |
| Open shadcn PRs | `1` | `bytefer/awesome-shadcn-ui#18`; `birobirobiro/awesome-shadcn-ui#493` merged |
| Open MCP PRs | `3` | TensorBlock, YuzeHao2023, and MobinX remain open; toolsdk merged |

## Star CTA

Use one ask everywhere:

```text
If this saves you from rebuilding the same shadcn/Tailwind system again, star the repo so more frontend teams can find it:
https://github.com/sarveshsea/memi
```

Do not ask for fake stars, star swaps, or bot engagement. The ask must sit after a demo, install command, or useful directory submission.

## First Move: Publish The MCP Patch

The official MCP Registry verifies npm package ownership by matching `server.json#name` to `package.json#mcpName`. npm `0.14.3` includes that metadata, but the registry still does not list Memoire. The next publish should be the `0.14.4` trust patch, then `server.json`.

Release gate:

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
SKIP_PACK_GATE=1 npm run check:release
npm run publish:ready
npm publish --access public
npm run growth:status
```

Then publish to the official MCP Registry:

```bash
mcp-publisher login github
mcp-publisher publish server.json
curl "https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=io.github.sarveshsea/memi"
```

Why this matters: the official registry only hosts metadata, but MCP directories and aggregators use it as a trust source. Once this is live, submit or refresh every MCP directory with the same npm/GitHub links.

## Launch Sequence For 12 Stars

1. Publish `0.14.4` with security hardening, `mcpName`, and `server.json`.
2. Publish to the official MCP Registry and verify search returns `io.github.sarveshsea/memi`.
3. Submit MCP.Directory, refresh Glama, submit Smithery, confirm PulseMCP and mcp.so indexing.
4. Follow up on open PRs only with new proof: official registry link, security hardening, or maintainer-requested fixes.
5. Ship one 60-second terminal demo: install, `memi diagnose`, `memi shadcn export`, `memi mcp config --install`.
6. Post the demo to X, Show HN, `r/mcp`, and `r/shadcn` with the GitHub star CTA.
7. Recheck stars daily for 7 days and record which surface drove each bump.

## Demo Script

```bash
npm i -g @memi-design/cli
memi diagnose --no-write
memi tokens --from ./src --report
memi shadcn export --out public/r
memi mcp config --install
```

Narrative:

```text
Most AI UI tools help create the first draft. Memoire is for the app after that: diagnose the messy shadcn/Tailwind codebase, extract the token system, export a shadcn-native registry, and give Claude Code/Cursor/Codex the same design-system context through MCP.
```

## Follow-Up Rules

- Follow up on a PR only when there is new proof: official registry URL, npm patch, demo video, or CI fix.
- Do not ping maintainers repeatedly for achievements.
- Do not submit to broad design lists until the public website and `/components` route are healthy.
- If a directory rejects Memoire as too broad, narrow the listing to the MCP server or shadcn registry export workflow.
