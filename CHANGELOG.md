# Mémoire Changelog

Mémoire is agent-native design memory, a registry-first design system CLI, and an MCP server. Teams and coding agents use it to audit UI quality, publish design systems, install real components, and connect Figma-driven workflows to code.

This changelog tracks Mémoire itself: every version, commit, and architectural decision that shapes the tool.

## Unreleased

### Design Skills migration — `3009cf63`

- Renamed the community repository to `sarveshsea/design-skills` and expanded the marketplace from 5 Notes to 78 installable Agent Skills with canonical `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` packaging.
- Added explicit upstream provenance and retained MIT notices for adapted Jakub Krehel, Emil Kowalski, and Josh Puckett DialKit material. Interface Craft remains a reference boundary and is not redistributed.
- Made Note archives deterministic and immutable by version, added strict manifest and path validation, and preserved legacy archive URLs during catalog rebuilds.
- Hardened catalog installs with HTTPS validation, exact signed-size checks, bounded streaming, decompression and uncompressed-size limits, safe tar parsing, and rejection of links, special files, and executables.
- Kept clean site builds self-contained by preserving checked-in official and community catalogs when companion source checkouts are unavailable.

## v2.5.0 — 2026-07-14 — Agent design CI recovery release

Product Hunt recovery release that makes the package story match the shipped product: agent design CI, Codex/MCP distribution, compact design-agent context, and spec-first file creation.

### Agent design CI
- Added `memi scaffold component|page` for dry-run Atomic Design file plans before any spec write.
- Added the MCP `scaffold_agent_design_files` tool. It is non-mutating by default and writes only when `approved=true`; generated code still goes through `generate_code` or `memi generate`.
- Added compact design-agent briefs with `memi agent brief --detail compact` and MCP `prepare_design_agent_brief detail=compact` to reduce first-turn context.

### Codex and package distribution
- Updated the root Agent Skill, Codex skill kit, and bundled Codex plugin skill with the file-creation contract.
- Bumped npm, MCP Registry descriptor, MCPB manifest, Codex plugin manifest, Claude plugin manifest, GitHub Action default, widget metadata, and skill registries to `2.5.0`.
- Refreshed README and `llms.txt` around compact briefs, spec-first scaffolds, and the `scaffold_agent_design_files` MCP tool.

### Public launch recovery
- Added a public-surface handoff document for npm, MCP, Codex Marketplace, Product Hunt, directory listings, website, and known stale surfaces.
- Reframed the launch goal around interface understanding for AI coding agents, with Studio as a companion proof surface instead of the headline.

## v2.4.1 — 2026-07-09 — Marketplace-ready Action + Grok Build kits

Patch release that unblocks GitHub Marketplace listing for the design CI Action and hardens Grok Build (Grok 4.5) agent-kit discovery.

### GitHub Action Marketplace
- Shortened `action.yml` `description` to ≤125 characters (Marketplace hard limit; `v2.4.0` still carried a 283-char description).
- Kept branding (`layout` / `purple`) and pinned the default CLI input to published npm `@memi-design/cli@2.4.1`.
- Documented Marketplace categories (Code quality + Continuous integration) and remaining UI publish steps in `docs/GITHUB_ACTION_MARKETPLACE.md`.

### Grok Build (Grok 4.5)
- Added `memi agent install grok-build` writing native `.grok/config.toml` (`[mcp_servers.memoire]` per xAI docs), `.grok/skills/`, and an `.agents/skills/` mirror.
- Raised MCP `startup_timeout_sec` for cold CLI starts; suite manifests enable `grok-build`.

### Skills ecosystem
- Adapted agent-first packaging patterns from [emilkowalski/skills](https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills): focused skill + REFERENCES companion, skills.sh badge, explicit upstream craft dependency (`npx skills add emilkowalski/skills`) without copying content.
- Cross-linked memi ↔ MCP ↔ Action ↔ design-sandbox ↔ craft skills in README, `llms.txt`, and agent-kit manifest `references`.

## v2.4.0 — 2026-07-09 — distribution proof release

The 2.4 line is the distribution-proof release: the npm package, MCP manifest, GitHub release assets, proof repos, and directory submission surfaces now point at the same installable product story.

### Release assets
- Hardened the tag-triggered release binary workflow with a single full Ubuntu release gate, deterministic `npm ci --include=optional --ignore-scripts` installs on every platform, and duplicated audit-gate skipping only inside platform binary jobs.
- Added a regression test for the binary workflow so Windows and Intel macOS release jobs keep the optional native package and audit-gate behavior that `v2.3.1` was missing.

### Distribution proof
- Bumped the public npm/MCP package metadata to `2.4.0` and synchronized generated shadcn registry metadata, widget metadata, and release docs.
- Made `v2.4.0` the version to use for the design-sandbox proof repo, MCP directory refreshes, Agent Skills seeding, shadcn examples, and AI coding starter-template submissions.

### Growth loop
- The launch target is no longer "publish and announce"; it is "publish, prove in runnable repos, then seed into package and agent directories." The weekly 10x checkpoint remains 7,830 npm downloads.
## v2.3.1 — 2026-07-07 — studio design-audit routes

Patch release syncing npm with main: the Studio sidecar server now exposes the design-audit engine over HTTP so memi Studio's native Design Health surface can drive it.

### Studio sidecar
- New routes: `POST /api/design-audit/run` (full scan, returns diagnosis + baseline-filtered active/suppressed findings + score history in one round trip), `GET /api/design-audit/latest` (cached read, 404 until first run), `POST /api/design-audit/accept-baseline`.
- New `src/studio/design-audit-store.ts` composing the existing `diagnoseAppQuality`/policy/baseline/history engine — no new audit logic, no LLM in the path.
- Fixed a double-append to the score-history ledger (`diagnoseAppQuality({write: true})` already appends internally; the route no longer appends a second time).
- Route-level tests covering the 404-until-run state, the run → latest → accept-baseline → re-run suppression flow, and the no-audit error path (216 → 217 test files).

## v2.3.0 — 2026-07-06 — the mandate release

memi 2.3 turns the audit you can run into a gate a team can require. The through-line is determinism and honesty: every finding cites file:line and re-runs identically, checkers check, gates gate, and no LLM sits in the enforcement path. Scores are only ever compared under the same committed policy; anything the scanner cannot see is reported "not-assessed", never scored.

### Report honesty + schema v2 (breaking for report consumers)
- UX tenets/traps and interface-craft reports move to **schemaVersion 2**: dimensions and tenets with no static evidence path now report `"not-assessed"` (craft scores become `number | null`) instead of "protected"/100. Every finding carries a `provenance` field (`static-scan` today; rendered-probe/vision/manual reserved).
- Deleted the fabricated screenshot findings (stat()-only checks that reported confidence 0.7) and renamed visual-parity's self-graded `deterministic-proof` mode to `demo-fixture` with an explicit disclaimer.

### CI gate that actually gates (bug fix)
- `memi diagnose --fail-on <severity>` — the old gate required a "critical" severity the engine never emits, and JSON mode had no gate at all, so CI exit codes were decorative. The gate now fires on real severities, works in JSON mode, and defaults from the committed policy.

### memoire.policy.json + committed baseline
- `memoire.policy.json` (presets `memi-recommended`/`strict`/`lenient`, 8 tunable thresholds, per-rule overrides) with a canonical sha256 **policy hash** stamped into every report. A malformed policy is a loud error, never a silent fallback.
- `memi baseline accept|status`: accept existing debt by line-number-independent content fingerprints; gates then fail only on NEW findings. Suppressed counts stay visible everywhere; stale fingerprints are listed as safe to prune.

### PR-scoped audits + score history
- `memi diagnose --changed/--files/--expand-imports`: whole-tree stats always computed (ratio thresholds stay valid) while emitted findings are scoped to the diff — a PR is only blamed for files it touched.
- Score history ledger (`.memoire/app-quality/history.jsonl`) with `--trend` and `--fail-on-regression`; regression checks only compare full scans under the same policy hash and honestly report "not comparable" otherwise.

### memi report + memi ci + shipped GitHub Action
- `memi report`: one self-contained design-health.html (+ markdown twin, deterministic SVG badge) composed from all persisted audits, with provenance badges and a not-assessed legend. `--redact` strips excerpts for NDA-safe sharing.
- `memi ci`: full-tree scan → PR scope → baseline filter → severity/minScore/regression gates → SARIF 2.1.0 (GitHub code-scanning annotations) + $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY scorecard + report artifact. Aggregate rules gate via score budgets, never per-file blame.
- Shipped composite action (`action.yml`, `uses: sarveshsea/memi@v2`) pinning the CLI version — gate behavior never drifts under a team. Dogfooded: memi's own CI runs `memi ci` against its committed policy and honestly-accepted baseline (2 findings in generated preview shells).

### memi init --team + doctor team checks
- `memi init --team`: committed policy + first scan with loudly-accepted baseline + managed .gitignore block (`.memoire/*` local, `baseline.json` shared, conflicting lines detected) + agent kit. Teammate re-runs preserve shared state and report policy drift.
- `memi doctor` gains a Team gate section: policy committed/parses, baseline present and policy-aligned, gitignore block current.

### Research data-safety + traceability
- Snapshot-before-purge: destructive re-ingests archive the research store to `research/snapshots/` (retention 20) before purging — expensive research data can no longer be silently destroyed.
- Selective `researchBacking`: research-design components now cite only the evidence backing their role instead of a blanket all-findings stamp; empty means honestly unbacked.
- `memi research trace|coverage` + `memi audit --research-traceability`: per-spec citation resolution (backed/unbacked/stale); the strict preset fails on stale citations.

### W3C Design Tokens (DTCG)
- Native DTCG read/write: `get_tokens` format `"dtcg"` exports a spec-compliant document; `sync_design_tokens` imports a `.tokens.json` (alias resolution with cycle guard, warnings never silently dropped); `update_token` matches DTCG dot-paths. Round-trips are lossless via a `cv.memoire` `$extensions` block.

### Docs
- New `docs/TEAM_ROLLOUT.md`, `docs/CI_RECIPES.md`, `docs/PRIVATE_REGISTRY.md`; README gains the mandate-loop section.

## v2.2.0 — 2026-07-04

Three structural fixes to real gaps: codegen was purely deterministic with no design judgment, the quality gate warned instead of blocking, and skill docs (Atomic Design, motion, design-system reference) were prose an agent could ignore with nothing downstream noticing. This release is a real engineering change, not a patch — several pieces are genuinely new capability, not tuning.

### Generative layout + design judgment
- New AI-assisted **layout composer** (`src/codegen/layout-composer.ts`): chooses a page's layout template and each section's grid arrangement/order, grounded in memi's own UX tenets/traps, instead of requiring the spec author to hardcode every value. Falls back to a deterministic keyword heuristic with zero AI dependency when no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, honors a new `layoutLocked` spec field to opt out entirely, and respects `MEMOIRE_DISABLE_LAYOUT_AI=1` for CI/batch `generate --all` runs that don't want extra LLM round-trips. Output stays deterministic shadcn/Tailwind — composition only picks among already-safe options, it does not generate arbitrary JSX.
- New AI **layout critic** (`src/codegen/layout-critic.ts`): scores already-generated page output (hierarchy, spacing rhythm, consistency, tenet risk) — genuine qualitative judgment, distinct from the regex rule-checker. Advisory only, never blocks; returns `null` (not an error) with no API key.
- `CodegenResult` gains an optional `critique` field, surfaced through `generate_code`'s MCP response and the CLI's `generate` output.

### Blocking quality gate
- `auditGeneratedFiles` now returns severity-classified `Finding[]` instead of plain warning strings. Raw hex/color findings and a new **token-pair contrast check** (reusing the existing name-convention pairing in `engine/accessibility.ts`) are `critical`; skill-compliance findings default to `warning` unless `--strict-skill-compliance` is set.
- **A critical finding now actually blocks the write** — no files written, no generation recorded — unless `force: true` (MCP) / `--force` (CLI) is passed. This is the core fix for "the quality gate warns, it doesn't block."
- `MemoireEngine.generateFromSpec` now returns the full `CodegenResult` (was: the entry file path as a bare string) so `blocked`/`findings`/`critique` survive to every caller — a breaking signature change, updated at all 9 call sites (CLI commands, MCP tools, the agent orchestrator, the autonomous pipeline, the registry installer).
- `generate_code` returns `isError: true` with the blocking findings when blocked — a real stop the calling agent must react to, not a warning buried in a success payload. The CLI's `generate` command exits non-zero on a blocked write.

### Skill-compliance enforcement
- New deterministic checker (`src/ux/skill-compliance.ts`) that verifies real source files — not just spec JSON — against the objectively-checkable rules in `skills/ATOMIC_DESIGN.md` (atom state/data-fetching/naming) and `skills/MOTION_VIDEO_DESIGN.md` (hardcoded durations, missing `prefers-reduced-motion`, non-GPU animated properties). This is the same mechanism a linter uses to enforce a style guide — it does not read the docs at runtime and does not make an agent "obey" markdown; it verifies compliance after the fact, whether the file was memi-generated or hand-written.
- `skills/DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md` has zero checkable rules (a pure external-system catalog) and is wired in only as a read-only benchmark annotation (`getReferenceCoverage`), never a pass/fail input — no fake rules were manufactured for it.
- New MCP tool `check_skill_compliance` and a new `run_audit` focus value (`"skill-compliance"`).
- New `memi audit --skill-compliance` CLI command — the one enforcement surface with real teeth: a non-zero exit code a CI step or pre-commit hook can actually depend on, since every other entry point (the MCP tool, the codegen gate's default non-strict mode) remains something an agent can choose not to call.
- Wired into `diagnoseAppQuality` (`AppQualityDiagnosis.compliance`) so the full project-quality scan covers it too.

## v2.1.1 — 2026-07-03

### Efficiency
- Trimmed the 23 most verbose MCP tool descriptions to compact Prereq/Returns/Errors contracts — the static tool schema every agent session loads dropped from ~26KB to ~13.5KB (roughly 3,000 fewer context tokens per session) while keeping every return shape, error contract, and cross-tool disambiguation hint.

## v2.1.0 — 2026-07-03

Quality release across three axes: designs that stay on-brand, a harness agents can trust, and a much leaner runtime.

### Better designer, always
- Contrast auditing now parses `oklch()`, `hsl()`, and `rgb()` colors via a shared parser — Tailwind v4 / shadcn token sets were previously skipped entirely by the WCAG checks, silently reporting clean scores. Theme validation gets the same treatment.
- Codegen cache fingerprints the full token set (names, types, values) instead of the token *count* — a rebrand now regenerates components instead of silently keeping old-brand output.
- `substituteTokensInClasses` prefers the project's own token CSS variables over the generic Tailwind palette (brand colors no longer approximate to `bg-blue-500`) and accepts oklch token values.
- Generated pages derive gap/padding/vertical rhythm from the project's spacing tokens instead of hardcoded `gap-4`/`p-6`.
- Codegen quality gate: generated files are scanned for raw hex and inline color literals; findings surface as `CodegenResult.warnings`.
- `run_audit` executes the deterministic WCAG/token checkers directly instead of routing through the LLM orchestrator — same contract, reproducible results, zero AI cost.

### More capable harness
- All 16 dotted tool names (`simulation.*`, `research.*`, `mermaid_jam.export`) renamed to underscore form — dots are rejected by Anthropic's tool-name pattern, which made those tools unusable in strict MCP clients.
- Every MCP tool now returns structured `{ isError: true }` results on unexpected throws (including "Figma not connected") instead of raw protocol errors.
- Numeric params gain real bounds (`maxFiles` ≤ 5000, `depth` ≤ 8, `scale` ≤ 4); caller-supplied ResearchStore JSON is structurally validated with readable errors.
- `update_token` reports `{ updated, pushedToFigma, reason }` — a requested-but-skipped Figma push is never silently dropped.
- New `simulation_list_runs` tool so agents can discover run ids instead of guessing them.
- Fixed root `.mcp.json` to launch `memi mcp start` (bare `memi mcp` was a no-op parent command); the MCP server now reports the real package version instead of a hardcoded 0.6.0.

### Efficiency
- CLI fast path: hot commands (`status`, `tokens`, `mcp`, `pull`, `theme`, `diagnose`, `ux`, `fix`, `add`, `generate`, `design-doc`, `audit`, `studio`) import only their own module instead of all ~48 — `diagnose` cold start dropped from ~1.5s to ~150ms, `status` to ~100ms. Bench thresholds tightened to lock the gains in.
- MCP responses drop pretty-printing (~30–50% fewer response tokens on every tool call). `get_tokens` gains type/name filters, `get_research` returns a summary-plus-counts overview unless specific sections are requested, and `simulation_stream` is paginated.
- AI client: large system prompts are sent with `cache_control` (Anthropic prompt caching), and vision JSON retries no longer re-send the base64 screenshot.
- `exceljs` is imported lazily at .xlsx parse time; the bench harness now reports payload sizes instead of discarding them.

## v2.0.0 — 2026-07-03

### Version 2 package release
This major release makes `@memi-design/cli` feel like the real install surface for memi, not just a CLI wrapper. Version 2 bundles the MCP server, standard Agent Skills package, Codex plugin, Studio harness runtime, UX audit layer, and design-system registry workflow behind one npm package.

### New
- Added `memi agent brief [target]` and the MCP `prepare_design_agent_brief` tool so agents can start UI work with a cost-aware preflight contract: evidence commands, design rules, compatibility installs, MCP/Agent Skills setup, and handoff requirements.
- Added `memi craft audit [target]` and MCP `audit_interface_craft` so interface craft is a first-class local gate across visual design, focusing mechanism, hierarchy, spacing rhythm, conventions, responsive resilience, and user context.
- Added a standard Agent Skills package at `skills/memoire-design-tooling/SKILL.md` so users can install memi through the broader skills ecosystem with `npx skills add sarveshsea/memi --skill memoire-design-tooling`.
- Added `memi agent install universal --project .`, which writes `.agents/skills/memoire-design-tooling` for agents that read the universal Agent Skills path.
- Added release gates that keep the root Agent Skills package, Codex skill kit, and bundled Codex plugin skill in sync.
- Promoted the Figma-independent MCP server path as a first-class package surface: `memi mcp start --no-figma` remains the registry-safe startup command for clients and crawlers.
- Reworked the package documentation around the v2 category: interface understanding for AI coding agents. The root README now leads with install proof, while deeper docs cover agent stacks, ECC-style workflows, UX/research audits, package positioning, and growth operations.
- Added `sarveshsea/design-sandbox` as the public proof repo for memi v2: a Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn, MCP, and Agent Skills workspace that demonstrates the interface-understanding loop in a real repository.

### Studio and harness
- Ships the newer Studio harness layer with Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini, Ollama, Hermes, and memi-native metadata, compatibility checks, and trace-friendly runtime events.
- Keeps Codex plugin distribution packaged with skills, MCP wiring, marketplace metadata, privacy and terms URLs, and PNG storefront assets.
- Includes the improved app-quality and UX Tenets and Traps audit flow across CLI, Studio, and MCP tools.

### Packaging and trust
- Bumps package, lockfile, MCP registry manifest, Codex plugin manifest, and example registry metadata to `2.0.0`.
- Keeps npm install side-effect free: no public lifecycle scripts, explicit Figma plugin setup, and explicit agent-kit install writes.
- Documents the safer trust ladder: dry-run native installer first, skills ecosystem install path second, and npm publish/public release checks last.
- Ships the v2 docs needed inside the npm tarball: docs map, interface-understanding protocol, agent stack guide, package positioning, growth plan, proof notes, release gates, and NOTICE attribution.
- Ships a public repo distribution playbook with GitHub topics, hashtags, proof commands, cost posture, compatibility surfaces, and the design-sandbox promotion path.

### Verification
- `npm run lint` passed.
- `npm test` passed with 205 files and 1572 tests.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `npm run check:release` passed.
- `npm run smoke:mcp` passed with 43 MCP tools.
- `npx skills@1.5.14 add . --list` found exactly `memoire-design-tooling`.
- `node dist/index.js agent install universal --dry-run --json` returned the expected `.agents/skills/memoire-design-tooling` plan.

## v1.1.1 — 2026-06-15

### Product Hunt launch alignment
- Refreshed launch, social, submission, and site handoff docs around the Studio-first story: **memi is the AI workbench for product designers**.
- Updated public agent-facing install guidance so `llms.txt` points at `@memi-design/cli` instead of the deprecated `@sarveshsea/memoire` alias.
- Fixed fast CLI help to present the live binary as `memi`.

### Security and release hygiene
- Resolved the production `form-data` advisory with a pinned `4.0.6` override while keeping the same Anthropic SDK line for same-day launch safety.
- Synced package, MCP registry, Codex plugin, widget, and example registry metadata for `1.1.1`.

### UX Tenets and Traps
- Added UX Tenets and Traps as a first-class audit concept across the app-quality engine, `memi diagnose`, `memi fix plan`, MCP `audit_ux_tenets_traps`, and the focused `memi ux audit` CLI.
- Shipped the built-in `UX_TENETS_TRAPS` skill plus the installable `ux-tenets-traps` Note package for framework guidance and screenshot audit workflows.
- Added Studio runtime support for `ux.audit_screenshot`, real macOS `captureScreen` artifacts, and app-quality UX reports under `.memoire/app-quality/`.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-06-06

### CLI self-update
- Add `memi self-update` to update the CLI itself: npm installs run `npm i -g @memi-design/cli@latest`; standalone binaries are pointed at `memi upgrade`. Supports `--check` and `--json`.
- Add a throttled, non-blocking "update available" notice on startup. It reads a once-per-day cache at `~/.memoire/update-check.json` and refreshes it in a detached background process, so the hot path never waits on the network. The notice is written to stderr, leaving stdout and `--json` output clean.
- Opt out with `MEMOIRE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`; opt in to silent auto-apply (npm installs only) with `MEMOIRE_AUTO_UPDATE=1`. The check is skipped in MCP, `--json`, non-TTY, and CI contexts, and never blocks or throws.
- Internal: extract `isStandaloneBinary` into `utils/runtime.ts` (shared by `upgrade` and the update checker); semver-precedence comparison with no new dependencies.

## v1.0.2 — 2026-05-14

### Studio runtime contracts
- Stabilize Studio runtime API contracts for session hydration, simulation tools, artifact state, usage, and design changelog flows so the macOS app can reopen agent work without blanking surfaces.

### Packaging
- Stabilize Figma plugin widget metadata generation so the packaged plugin ships deterministic widget assets and avoids dirty local screenshot state.

## v1.0.1 — 2026-05-12

### Docs
- README install section now lists pnpm and yarn variants alongside npm (single bash block, three lines).

### Packaging
- Exclude `plugin/*.png` from the npm tarball — prevents stray local screenshots in the plugin folder from blowing past the size gate.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-05-10

### Rebrand and stability commitment
First stable release as **memi**. The npm package stays on `@memi-design/cli`, the GitHub repo consolidates under `sarveshsea/memi`, and the brand moves to a single lowercase wordmark. Same engine, same MCP server, same Codex plugin — clearer name, single CLI binary (`memi`), and a real homepage at `memoire.cv`.

### Breaking
- **npm package renamed**: `@memi-design/cli` → `@memi-design/cli`. Reinstall with `npm i -g @memi-design/cli`. The old package will receive a final deprecation publish pointing here.
- **CLI binaries trimmed**: `memoire` and `design-extract` aliases removed. Use `memi` only.
- **GitHub repo renamed**: `sarveshsea/memi` → `sarveshsea/memi`. Old URL auto-redirects.
- **Codex marketplace command updated**: `codex plugin marketplace add sarveshsea/memi --ref main --sparse .agents/plugins --sparse plugins/memoire` (was `sarveshsea/memi`).

### Distribution-fix highlights
- `package.json` description rewritten as a single value-prop sentence.
- `package.json` keywords trimmed from 70+ to 10 high-intent terms.
- README hero now shows the demo GIF inline on the npm page (rendered from GitHub raw URL — keeps the package size under the size gate).
- `README.md` hero replaced with single install line + 30-second example.
- Homepage now points to `memoire.cv`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the new Tuesday-only release cadence and semver discipline from 1.0 onward.

## v0.18.0 — 2026-05-10

### The upgrade
Two large architectural changes plus the runtime + macOS-app split. PR #15 carved the Tauri studio app out to github.com/sarveshsea/memi-studio (FSL-1.1-ALv2, Humyn LLC). PR #17 replaced the legacy harness dispatch with a t3code-shaped event-sourced architecture: branded entity IDs, a discriminated-union ProviderRuntime event union, session + turn state machines, eight per-harness drivers (Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Hermes, Ollama, Gemini, memoire-native, plus a JsonLineDriver shared base), an in-memory + on-disk snapshot store with crash recovery, an append-only event journal with replay-from-cursor, a periodic maintenance runner, a typed RPC dispatcher, an EventBus, a UsageRollup, and the @sarveshsea/memi-studio-types package skeleton. PR #18 added the execute_code primitive: programmatic tool calling via Unix-socket RPC, four security profiles, and an injectable child-process runtime — multi-step pipelines that today cost N model turns now collapse to one.

### New
- Effect.js-based driver layer with eight per-harness drivers and a contract-conformance test that locks the canonical event surface across all of them (PR #17 commits 1–8).
- Per-session snapshot store + restore-on-reconnect — kill the runtime mid-turn, restart, the session resumes (PR #17 commit 9).
- Append-only event journal at `.memoire/studio/events/<sessionId>.jsonl` with replay-from-cursor (PR #17 commit 10).
- Maintenance runner that prunes stale snapshots and journals on a 30s tick (PR #17 commit 11).
- Typed RPC protocol + dispatcher (`dispatchCommand`, `subscribeThread`, `replayEvents`, `subscribeShell`, `getTurnDiff`) at `src/studio/rpc/` (PR #17 commit 12).
- In-process EventBus with filtered subscriptions for cluster A–E primitives (PR #17 commit 13).
- UsageRollup that subscribes to the bus and exposes per-session, per-harness, per-tool token + cost queries (PR #17 commit 14).
- `@sarveshsea/memi-studio-types` package skeleton at `packages/memi-studio-types/` for memi-studio's frontend (PR #17 commit 15).
- `execute_code` primitive at `src/studio/exec/`: tools-rpc protocol + Unix-socket server, typed `memi_tools` stub generator, child-process spawn lifecycle with env scrub + memory + timeout caps, four security profiles (`tight`, `read-only`, `standard`, `broad` with approval), and `STUDIO_EXECUTE_CODE.md` cookbook (PR #18).

### Carve-out
- `apps/studio/` moved to [github.com/sarveshsea/memi-studio](https://github.com/sarveshsea/memi-studio) (FSL-1.1-ALv2, Humyn LLC).
- `scripts/build-studio-runtime.mjs` refactored to write to `dist-bin/` + `dist-runtime-resources/` instead of the now-deleted `apps/studio/src-tauri` paths.
- Deleted: `scripts/{publish-studio-macos,studio-macos-release,studio-perf-audit,studio-workbench-e2e}.mjs`, `docs/STUDIO_MACOS_RELEASE.md`, six studio-only npm scripts.
- Added: `.github/workflows/runtime-release.yml` — builds + publishes the sidecar binaries + resources tarball on `runtime-v*` tag pushes (PR #15 + #16 fix).

### Verification
- 1520 tests across 196 files, both root + apps/studio typechecks clean
- Per-PR CI: PR #15, #16, #17, #18 all green at merge time
- `runtime-v0.18.1` release published with darwin-arm64 + darwin-x64 sidecar binaries + resources tarball; `runtime-v0.18.2` to follow this release with the post-rewrite sidecar

## v0.17.0 — 2026-05-07

### The upgrade
This minor cuts the bundled wave of Mermaid Jam, research-backed vibe design, the clean-room simulation domain, Model Swarm V2, Studio Automations, the Codex plugin package, and 19 new agent/motion Notes onto a single coordinated release across the npm package, MCP registry, macOS Studio DMG, and the marketing site.

### New
- Added a native Mermaid Jam integration for routing Mermaid and markdown diagram source into the Mermaid Jam FigJam plugin.
- Added `memi mermaid-jam status` / `memi mermaid-jam open`, a Studio `/api/integrations/mermaid-jam` endpoint, and a built-in `mermaid-jam` Note for agent workflows.
- Added research-backed vibe design packages with `memi research design`, `memi mermaid-jam export --from`, Studio/MCP `research.design_package`, `research.generate_specs`, and `mermaid_jam.export` tools.
- Added the clean-room `src/simulation/` domain, `memi simulate` CLI, Studio/MCP simulation tools, Scenario Lab surface, and optional simulation fork bridge adapter.
- Added Model Swarm Simulation V2 with Codex-first profiles, deterministic fallback routing, 20-60 agent cohorts, transcripts, matrices, comparisons, costs, and Scenario Lab model/cost/transcript surfaces.
- Added Mémoire Studio Automations with Codex-style JSON workspace definitions, JSONL run history, design-harness templates, runtime API routes, CLI commands, and a macOS user LaunchAgent scheduler.
- Added a native Studio Automations center with template creation, edit, pause/resume, run-now, run history, scheduler status, and safe write-policy controls for Codex design harness work.
- Added a Codex plugin package for Memoire with bundled skill context, MCP server wiring, repo-local marketplace metadata, and `memi agent install codex-plugin`.
- Added public Git-backed Codex marketplace distribution docs, store-ready PNG plugin assets, screenshots, privacy/terms links, `/codex-plugin` site copy, and a `smoke:codex-plugin` gate.
- Added 19 new agent and motion Notes covering memory profiles, messaging gateway, session checkpoints, skill migration, apple-desktop-automation, approval sandbox policies, browser-research-agent, cron workflows, gateway ops observability, hermes/openclaw bridges, mcp-server-studio, model-router-diagnostics, multi-agent-kanban, secure-secrets, hyperframes-video, remotion-video, motion-performance, and website-to-video.
- Refreshed animation-craft to depend on the new motion-performance, remotion-video, and hyperframes-video Notes.
- Added a macOS-first native Markdown Corpus path for Studio: reviewed GitHub markdown seeds download through the Rust/Tauri app into `.memoire/markdown-corpus`, with manifest hashes, license policy, and markdown-only allowlisting.
- Added deep Markdown analysis for FigJam candidates, including Mermaid fences, headings, lists, tables, frontmatter, links, and checklist-to-flow conversion.
- Added `memi mermaid-jam corpus status`, `memi mermaid-jam corpus sync --setup`, `memi mermaid-jam analyze`, and Studio `/api/markdown-corpus/*` endpoints for corpus setup, status, analysis, and FigJam sync.
- Added a Studio Markdown Corpus setup card with repository status, source-path analysis, and direct "Sync to FigJam" handoff through the connected bridge.

### Fixed
- Studio surface routing no longer snaps back to the workbench when opening a session summary or starting a new chat, so the user-selected surface persists across session changes.
- Studio trace view-model derives activities once and reuses them for active-process inference, fixing the reasoning-live behavior covered by view-model.test.ts.

### Security
- Added a release gate and unit coverage that fail if packaged files contain copied third-party fork source markers while allowing written references and optional fork bridge documentation.

### Verification
- Focused Mermaid Jam resolver, CLI, and Studio API tests passed.
- Focused research design package, Mermaid Jam export, Studio tool, MCP registration, and Scenario Lab UI tests passed.
- Focused Rust/Tauri Markdown Corpus tests passed.
- Focused Markdown Corpus integration, CLI, and Studio API tests passed.
- Packaged Note asset tests and Studio Marketplace tests passed.
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- Focused simulation core, CLI, Studio tool, and license-boundary tests passed.
- Focused Studio automation store, server, CLI, scheduler, and workbench UI tests passed.
- Focused Codex plugin packaging and agent-install tests passed.
- Focused Codex plugin store-readiness, site-bundle, and marketplace smoke tests passed.

## v0.16.3 — 2026-05-06

### The upgrade
This patch republishes the native-runtime trust fixes under a new immutable npm version after `0.16.2` was already present on npm. It keeps the supply-chain repair intact while ensuring the published Studio runtime, agent envelope, and packaged web assets default to guarded execution.

### Fixed
- Restored guarded Studio execution as the default permission mode in the macOS/web shell.
- Restored guarded defaults in Studio agent-envelope context so missing session metadata no longer falls back to `full_access`.
- Kept shell access disabled by default and computer actions approval-gated in the default Studio config.
- Kept the Figma companion on Studio web/runtime defaults `1420` and `8765`, with bridge hello messages serialized through the v2 bridge envelope.

### Verification
- `npm run prepublishOnly` passed with release checks, production audit, typecheck, 1,243 tests, and build.
- `npm run pack:dry-run` and `npm run smoke:mcp` passed.
- Pulled the public `0.16.2` tarball to confirm npm immutability required a `0.16.3` patch instead of republishing over `0.16.2`.

## v0.16.2 — 2026-05-06

### The upgrade
This patch repairs the public-package trust surface before the next growth push. Memoire no longer performs npm install-time writes, the default Figma plugin disables raw JavaScript execution, production dependencies clear high audit findings, and native agent installs now create daemon-aware suite context for low-latency Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Hermes, and OpenClaw workflows.

### New
- Added `memi daemon start|status|stop` as the shared local runtime entrypoint for CLI, Studio, MCP, and agent adapters.
- Added `memi suite init|doctor|run <recipe>` plus `memoire.agent.yaml` so agents share one YAML contract for product memory, harnesses, skills, and product-team recipes.
- Made `memi agent install` plan or write `memoire.agent.yaml` and updated Hermes, OpenClaw, Codex, and OpenCode kits to prefer warmed daemon context, suite recipes, and `memi mcp start --no-figma`.
- Added explicit plugin setup/repair commands with `memi setup plugin` and `memi doctor --repair-plugin`.

### Security
- Removed public npm lifecycle scripts for `prepare` and `postinstall`; packaged installs no longer write to `~/.memoire` automatically.
- Updated `@chenglou/pretext` and MCP/transitive dependency ranges, then added `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` to release gates.
- Added text-length and repeated-punctuation guards before Pretext measurement falls through to `prepare()`.
- Disabled raw Figma JavaScript execution in the default packaged plugin and removed the public MCP `figma_execute` tool.

### Verification
- Release checks now fail on public lifecycle scripts, packed lifecycle helpers, unsynced release metadata, stale changelog preview, and production high audit findings.
- Focused daemon, suite, agent-kit, text-measurement, supply-chain, and MCP smoke tests cover the new trust and runtime paths.

## v0.16.1 — 2026-05-06

### The upgrade
This patch makes the packaged Studio feel cleaner and more accountable. The macOS/web shell now uses bundled Geist Sans, neutral editor-style surfaces, and a model-agnostic reference trace so every harness run can show which Memoire npm package, specs, knowledge, files, and Figma state were provided.

### New
- Added root `llms.txt` and `docs/AGENT_RECIPES.md` so Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Hermes, and OpenClaw can discover when to use Memoire before frontend work.
- Hardened publish readiness with npm-owner checks for `sarveshsea`, clearer E404 auth guidance, and a real MCP stdio smoke test that lists required tools from the built package.
- Switched MCP Registry package startup metadata to `memi mcp start --no-figma` so Glama and MCP crawlers can inspect tools without a live Figma bridge.
- Added bundled Geist Sans to the Studio web package for offline desktop rendering.
- Switched Studio light and dark surfaces to neutral white/grey and charcoal/grey tokens while keeping sunset as the restrained active accent.
- Added `reference_trace` Studio events and `/api/sessions/:id/trace` reference summaries for package, spec, knowledge, Figma, file, artifact, and model evidence.
- Added a Details drawer reference trace panel so Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, Memoire Native, and other harnesses expose the same source chain.

### Verification
- Focused Studio CSS, workbench UI, trace, server trace, agent envelope, publish readiness, MCP stdio smoke, and release metadata tests passed locally.
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test -- --run`, `npm run build`, `npm run studio:build`, `npm run check:release`, and `npm run pack:dry-run` are the release gates for this version.

## v0.16.0 — 2026-05-06

### The upgrade
This release makes Memoire distributable as AI-native design tooling for other agents. The new agent kits now ship inside the npm package, install into Hermes, OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode, and expose a mirror-ready skill repo shape for `sarveshsea/memoire-agent-skills`.

### New
- Added `memi agent install [target]` for `hermes`, `openclaw`, `claude-code`, `cursor`, `codex`, `opencode`, and `all`, with `--dry-run`, `--json`, `--force`, `--project`, and `--global`.
- Added packaged `agent-kits/` assets with Hermes and OpenClaw `memoire-design-tooling` skills, Codex/OpenCode skill-style context packs, and MCP config templates for Claude Code and Cursor.
- Added Studio web and macOS app agent-kit controls so users can dry-run, install, and force-refresh Memoire kits without leaving the desktop workbench.
- Added a mirror-ready agent skills tree for `sarveshsea/memoire-agent-skills`.
- Updated README and mirror docs with first-fold agent install commands, macOS Studio DMG positioning, native agent support paths, and ClawHub/Hermes discovery copy.
- Made the Hermes Studio envelope prefer the `memoire-design-tooling` skill, `memi status`, `memi compose`, project memory, Figma bridge state, specs, tokens, and research context.
- Updated npm metadata for agent skills, OpenClaw, ClawHub, Hermes skills, Skill.md, and AI design tooling discovery.

### Verification
- Focused agent install, packaged agent kit, Studio runtime API, macOS Tauri command, Hermes envelope, harness, and release metadata tests passed.
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, `npm run pack:dry-run`, and `npm run prepublishOnly` are the release gates for this version.

### External Release Gates
- Publish `0.16.0` to npm after the local release gate passes.
- Create or update `sarveshsea/memoire-agent-skills` from `agent-kits/mirror`.
- Submit or refresh ClawHub/Hermes skill listings using the packaged `memoire-design-tooling` skills.

## v0.15.0 — 2026-05-06

### The upgrade
This release turns Mémoire into an agent-first Studio platform instead of only a registry/design-system CLI. Studio now has a packaged web shell, a desktop-first Tauri app slice, project memory, an active Figma bridge controller, and harness compatibility for Mémoire Native, Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, OpenCode, Gemini, Ollama, and guarded shell runs.

### New
- Added Mémoire Studio runtime commands: `memi studio status`, `memi studio serve`, `memi studio run`, `memi studio logs`, `memi studio tui`, and `memi studio web`.
- Added first-class TUI/log visibility for persisted `.memoire/studio/sessions/*.jsonl` runs, including package logs, harness logs, auth status, tool calls, artifacts, and session results.
- Added `memi video create`, `memi video preview`, `memi video render`, and `memi video status` for filesystem-first Remotion and HyperFrames motion/video projects under `.memoire/videos`.
- Added a packaged Studio web app under `dist/studio-web` so globally installed npm packages can run Studio without needing the source checkout.
- Added shared harness manifests, command-template expansion, provider/workspace/env policy metadata, install probes, and agent prompt envelopes for design, UX research, specs, systems, Figma, and project-memory context.
- Added output normalizers for Claude Code stream JSON, Codex JSONL, Hermes text, Ollama/local output, grouped stdout/stderr, tool calls, reasoning events, and structured `session_result` blocks.
- Added filesystem-first project memory for Home, Research, Specs, Systems, Monitor, and Changelog while filtering stale bid/AICP/generated preview artifacts from Studio memory.
- Added a compact active Figma bridge controller with connect/disconnect, native open, port scanning, client status, full sync, inspect, pull tokens, pull components, pull stickies, and screenshot actions.
- Added Studio UI markers and a dense old-Mémoire-inspired product-memory shell, with the harness terminal scoped to Home and Monitor instead of taking over the whole app.
- Added a compact active-widget Studio home surface and a Notes Marketplace for built-in, workspace-installed, and installable Mémoire Notes packages.
- Added tagged-release macOS DMG publishing for Mémoire Studio so app downloads live on GitHub Releases instead of in git.
- Added Hermes/Warp interface attribution and license-boundary notes while excluding Warp AGPL app/client code from copied implementation.

### Compatibility
- Claude Code runs with a Mémoire design/research system envelope and stream JSON parsing.
- Claude Code and Codex now surface CLI auth readiness before a harness run.
- Codex runs with JSON event streaming, workspace-scoped prompts, and design-agent context injection.
- Hermes runs with terminal/file/memory/skills/todo/session-search toolsets and a Mémoire UX/research wrapper.
- Ollama and local-model routes receive the same structured prompt envelope for offline design workflows.
- Remotion and HyperFrames are optional video adapters, so package installs remain lightweight while video workflows become native when the tools exist.
- Packaged `memi studio web` serves the same Studio UI and API from one localhost runtime when the source `apps/studio` Vite app is not present.

### Verification
- Focused Studio harness, package-compatibility, Figma, memory, and release-version tests cover the new runtime paths.
- Focused Marketplace API, Studio workbench UI, and compact table CSS tests cover the Notes Marketplace and active-widget shell.
- Focused Studio log/TUI, auth probe, Figma open, and video workflow tests cover the 0.15 visibility and motion pass.
- `npm run build` passed and copied the Studio web bundle into `dist/studio-web`.
- `npm test -- --run` passed with 133 files and 1161 tests.
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- `npm --prefix apps/studio run build` passed.
- `cargo test --quiet` passed in `apps/studio/src-tauri`.
- `npm run studio:build` passed and produced `Mémoire Studio.app` plus the macOS DMG bundle.
- `npm run check:release` and `npm run pack:dry-run` passed for `0.15.0`.
- Packaged-mode smoke verification passed from a temporary non-source project directory.

## v0.14.4 — 2026-04-30

### The fix
This patch hardens Memoire for public directory review. GitHub Note installs now avoid shell-string cloning, standalone binary upgrades fail closed when checksum metadata is missing, and the release workflow has a live growth/status command for npm, GitHub, MCP Registry, SafeSkill, and directory PR tracking.

### New
- Added strict `github:owner/repo` validation and argument-safe Git clone execution for Note installs.
- Added `memi upgrade --allow-unverified`; upgrades now require SHA256 verification by default and only skip missing checksum metadata when explicitly requested.
- Added `npm run growth:status` for npm version/downloads, GitHub stars, Official MCP Registry presence, SafeSkill PR status, and directory PR status.
- Added `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `.github/FUNDING.yml`, and `docs/OFFICIAL_MCP_REGISTRY.md`.
- Updated Starstruck, submissions, achievements, metrics, and release-gate docs around the current `0.14.4` trust patch.

### Verification
- Focused Notes installer and upgrade checksum tests passed.
- `npm run growth:status` passed and reported npm latest `0.14.3`, `7` GitHub stars, Official MCP Registry absent, SafeSkill PR `20/100`, and `9` stars remaining for Starstruck.
- `npm run lint` passed.
- `npm test` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `npm run bench:cli` passed with all tracked commands below thresholds.
- `SKIP_PACK_GATE=1 npm run check:release` passed for `0.14.4`.
- `MEMOIRE_PUBLISH_READY_SKIP_AUTH=1 MEMOIRE_PUBLISH_READY_SKIP_GIT=1 npm run publish:ready` passed before commit.

- Close or replace the blocked SafeSkill badge only after the score improves.

## v0.14.3 — 2026-04-28

### The fix
This patch makes the code-first workflow faster and the release path safer. `memi diagnose` now reuses one source scan for both quality diagnosis and app graph analysis, source scanning skips oversized local files, and maintainers get a dedicated publish-readiness gate before npm/MCP Registry pushes.

### New
- Reused scanned source files between app-quality diagnosis and app-graph construction to avoid duplicate directory walks and file reads.
- Added source byte accounting and scan/analysis timing to diagnosis summaries.
- Added `maxBytesPerFile` support to the shared source scanner and applied it to diagnosis, app graphing, and token extraction.
- Added `npm run publish:ready` to verify npm auth, version drift, MCP metadata, git cleanliness, and package contents before publish.

### Verification
- Focused app-quality and source-scanner tests passed.
- `npm run lint` passed.
- `npm test` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `npm run bench:cli` passed with all tracked CLI commands below thresholds.
- `MEMOIRE_PUBLISH_READY_SKIP_AUTH=1 MEMOIRE_PUBLISH_READY_SKIP_GIT=1 node scripts/publish-ready.mjs` passed after the version bump.
- `SKIP_PACK_GATE=1 npm run check:release` passed for `0.14.3`.

- Publish `0.14.3` to npm.
- Run `mcp-publisher publish` after npm reports `0.14.3`.

## v0.14.2 — 2026-04-27

### The fix
This patch publishes the MCP Registry verification metadata that landed after the first `0.14.1` npm publish. npm now needs a fresh version because the public `0.14.1` package does not expose `package.json#mcpName` to the official MCP Registry verifier.

### New
- Bumped package metadata, lockfile, plugin widget metadata, examples, and `server.json` to `0.14.2`.
- Kept the MCP server name stable as `io.github.sarveshsea/memoire`.
- Kept npm package transport as stdio with the `memi mcp` positional argument.

### Verification
- `SKIP_PACK_GATE=1 npm run check:release` passed for `0.14.2`.

### Commits

- Verify `npm view @memi-design/cli version mcpName --json` reports `0.14.2` and `io.github.sarveshsea/memoire`.
- Publish `server.json` with `mcp-publisher publish`.

## v0.14.1 — 2026-04-26

### The fix
This release line rebuilds Mémoire around shadcn-native registry export: diagnose an existing Tailwind app, emit registry files that work with shadcn and v0, and install those registries from npm, URLs, aliases, or local paths.

### New
- Added shadcn `registry.json` and `registry-item.json` Zod schemas with file targets, dependencies, registryDependencies, cssVars, blocks, pages, hooks, lib files, themes, and non-breaking Memoire metadata.
- Added `memi shadcn export`, `memi shadcn doctor`, and `memi shadcn serve` for shadcn-native `/r/*.json` registry output.
- Added token-to-shadcn `cssVars.theme`, `cssVars.light`, and `cssVars.dark` mapping from extracted Memoire tokens.
- Added remote npm registry resolution with tarball cache, TTL, `--refresh`, and shasum/integrity verification.
- Added shadcn item installation through `memi add` and `memi registry install`, including local path, URL, npm, GitHub-compatible refs, and catalog aliases.
- Added app graph analysis for routes, components, imports, shadcn usage, CSS files, tokens, and package metadata.
- Upgraded app-quality diagnosis with evidence locations, affected files, confidence, estimated effort, and fix categories.
- Added `memi fix plan` and `memi fix apply --yes` for evidence-backed UI fix planning and safe mechanical accessibility fixes.
- Added v0 Open-in-v0 metadata, MCP tools, website-ready marketplace bundle generation, shadcn/v0 workflow docs, SEO docs, and launch campaign copy.
- Added an achievement-safe community growth kit with GitHub issue forms, discussion category forms, PR template guidance, a directory submission matrix, and a GitHub achievement tracker.
- Added official MCP Registry metadata with `package.json#mcpName`, root `server.json`, npm stdio package arguments, and release checks for registry consistency.
- Tracked shadcn directory submissions for `bytefer/awesome-shadcn-ui` and `birobirobiro/awesome-shadcn-ui` as legitimate Pull Shark candidates.
- Added a Starstruck distribution plan that prioritizes a `0.14.2` MCP metadata patch, official MCP Registry publish, MCP directory refreshes, useful awesome-list PRs, demo copy, and a legitimate GitHub star CTA.

### Public API Changes
- New commands: `memi shadcn export`, `memi shadcn serve`, `memi shadcn doctor`, `memi fix plan`, `memi fix apply`, and `memi registry install <component> --from <ref>`.
- `memi add` can now fall back to shadcn registry item installs and resolve catalog aliases without a preinstalled local package.
- `memi registry doctor --refresh` and `memi add --refresh` refresh cached npm registry tarballs.
- MCP now exposes `get_shadcn_registry`, `get_registry_item`, `diagnose_app_quality`, and `plan_ui_fixes`.
- Generated website bundle: `examples/site-bundle/` with catalog JSON, item JSON, screenshots, SEO metadata, sitemap, and copy snippets.

### Verification
- `npm run lint` passed after each blueprint block.
- `npm run validate:presets` passed for all 11 presets.
- `npm run build:marketplace` and `npm run build:site-bundle` generated clean outputs.
- Focused shadcn, remote registry, npm cache, app graph/fix, MCP, and site bundle tests passed.
- `npm run check:release` passed throughout the release work.
- `npm run bench:cli` passed: help median `26ms`, diagnose median `381ms`, tokens median `640ms`, status median `392ms`.
- `npm run pack:dry-run` passed: package size `1,077,934` bytes, unpacked size `3,882,863` bytes, `464` files, under the `1,250,000` byte gate.

### Key Design Decisions
- **Shadcn-native is the wedge** — The install path should match the ecosystem developers already use: `shadcn`, v0, AI editors, npm, and registry URLs.
- **Bridge existing apps first** — Developers should be able to start from a real shadcn/Tailwind codebase, not a Figma-only workflow.
- **Add V2 without breaking V1** — Old registry commands stay valid while shadcn-compatible artifacts become the new default output surface.
- **Remote install must not require node_modules** — npm package refs and catalog aliases now resolve through cached tarballs when local installs are missing.
- **Fixes must be evidence-backed** — Diagnosis and fix planning carry file evidence, confidence, effort, and write-safety rather than vague lint output.
- **Website proof is repo-owned** — `examples/site-bundle` gives the site catalog data, registry items, screenshots, SEO pages, and sitemap entries from one generated source.

### External Release Gates
- Publish `0.13.1` first if npm latest is still behind the repo, then publish `0.14.1`.
- Verify npm latest reports `0.14.1`, README contains `Shadcn-native Design CI for Tailwind apps`, and `memi --version` returns `0.14.1`.
- Update GitHub description/topics from `docs/SITE_HANDOFF.md`.
- Deploy `/components` from `examples/site-bundle/catalog.json`; no empty state is allowed.
- Recheck npm weekly/monthly downloads, GitHub stars, README CTA, and `/components` health after 7 days.

## v0.13.1 — 2026-04-26

### The fix
This patch release turns the registry marketplace into the growth wedge: more installable example registries, catalog data the website can mirror, discovery commands, and stronger registry package proof.

### New
- Added manual publish workflow dispatch plus npm post-publish verification for latest version, README phrase, and global install command.
- Bumped package, lockfile, plugin metadata, preview badges, example registries, and release checks to `0.13.1`.
- Added Marketplace Catalog V1 with repo-owned schema, deterministic generation, npm-shipped `assets/marketplace-catalog.v1.json`, and website-mirror `examples/marketplace-catalog.v1.json`.
- Expanded first-party marketplace inventory from 7 to 11 registries with new `landing-page`, `auth-flow`, `ai-chat`, and `ecommerce` presets.
- Added showcase screenshots, tokens, specs, React code, README proof, install commands, and source links for every new preset.
- Added `memi registry list`, `memi registry search <query>`, `memi registry info <slug>`, and `memi registry doctor <ref>`.
- Added featured alias resolution so users can run commands like `memi add ChatComposer --from ai-chat` and `memi view starter-saas/Button --print`.
- Improved `memi add` output with usage snippets, token install commands, npm/source links, and missing-component suggestions.
- Updated `memi view` to print npm plus planned Marketplace URLs for catalog-backed aliases.
- Strengthened generated registry package READMEs and `package.json` keywords/marketplace tags for npm conversion.
- Added marketplace SEO docs, site handoff copy, category-specific launch posts, and proof docs for the 11-registry catalog.

### Verification
- `npm run lint` passed after the third implementation block.
- `npm run validate:presets` passed for all 11 presets.
- `npm run build:marketplace` regenerated identical catalog copies.
- Focused marketplace, registry, add, view, publisher, and doctor tests passed.
- `npm run check:release` passed throughout the release work.
- `npm run bench:cli` passed: help median `29ms`, diagnose median `373ms`, tokens median `652ms`, status median `383ms`.
- `npm run pack:dry-run` passed: package size `1,043,394` bytes, unpacked size `3,701,166` bytes, `434` files, under the `1,250,000` byte gate.

### Key Design Decisions
- **Lead with installable inventory** — Marketplace growth depends on useful registries users can install immediately.
- **Keep changes additive** — `0.13.1` is a patch release, so existing `memi add`, `publish`, `view`, `tokens`, and `diagnose` behavior remains compatible.
- **Catalog is the source of truth** — The website, CLI, docs, and launch copy should mirror `marketplace-catalog.v1.json` instead of hand-maintaining separate lists.
- **Aliases improve activation** — Slugs like `ai-chat`, `auth-flow`, and `landing-page` are easier to remember than scoped package names, while package-name refs remain supported.
- **npm stays the conversion URL** — Until `/components` is deployed and healthy, every launch post and external CTA points to `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@memi-design/cli`.
- **Doctor before distribution** — Registry packages now have a CI-friendly validation path before teams publish or mirror them.

### External Release Gates
- Publish `0.13.1` to npm and verify npm latest reports `0.13.1`.
- Update GitHub description to `Design CI for shadcn/Tailwind apps: diagnose UI debt, extract tokens, and publish installable registries.`
- Update GitHub topics to include `design-ci`, `shadcn-registry`, `tailwind-audit`, `token-extraction`, `ui-quality`, and `tweakcn`.
- Deploy `/components` from `examples/marketplace-catalog.v1.json`; fall back to `examples/featured-registries.json` if the full catalog cannot load.
- Recheck npm weekly/monthly downloads and GitHub stars 7 days after publish.

## v0.13.0 — 2026-04-26

### The fix
This release makes Memoire a code-first Design CI tool for shadcn/Tailwind apps: diagnose real UI debt, extract tokens from code, and publish improved systems as installable registries.

### New
- Bumped the public release line to `0.13.0` so the next npm publish can carry the Design CI positioning, faster CLI work, and code-first docs under one semver release.
- Added high-intent npm keywords for `design-ci`, UI quality, shadcn/Tailwind audits, token extraction, design tokens, tweakcn, and registry publishing.
- Updated shipped examples, preview badges, plugin metadata, and release checks to the new release marker.
- Rewrote the npm README, docs quickstart, launch copy, submission templates, and site SEO handoff around one npm-first conversion path.
- Added a `0.13` code-first demo, no-Figma proof examples, weekly growth scorecard, and standalone social launch posts for X, shadcn, tweakcn, and dev-design audiences.

### Performance
- Fast-pathed global `memi --help` and `memi --version` before importing the engine or full command graph; benchmark median is now under `30ms` on the built CLI.
- Added engine init profiles: `minimal`, `registry`, and `full`, so light commands can avoid notes, agents, and health loops.
- Added a shared concurrent source scanner with deterministic traversal, ignore dirs, file budgets, URL timeouts, and bounded parallel reads.
- Moved token extraction and diagnosis onto the shared scanner; `memi tokens --from ...` now avoids engine init unless `--save` needs registry persistence.
- Added `scripts/bench-cli.mjs` and `npm run bench:cli` with gates for help, diagnosis, token extraction, and status.
- Hardened pack dry-run checks with a temp-copy `npm run pack:dry-run` audit and a dry-run-safe prepare script.

### Key Design Decisions
- **Prioritize code-first adoption** — Developers can start from an existing shadcn/Tailwind app without opening Figma.
- **Use Design CI as the wedge** — Public copy should sell repeatable UI quality checks and registry publishing, not a broad AI design platform.
- **Keep npm as the only primary CTA** — Until the deployed `/components` page is reliable, every growth surface sends traffic to `@memi-design/cli`.
- **Measure conversion weekly** — Download recovery is tracked by npm latest, weekly/monthly downloads, GitHub metadata, README CTA clarity, and website health.
- **Treat performance as activation** — A sub-300ms help path and faster code scans make the first 60 seconds of adoption feel credible.

## v0.12.4 — 2026-04-16 (Growth surfaces)

### The fix
This release aligns the npm package, repo docs, example catalog, and launch assets around one public wedge: publish Figma or tweakcn design systems as installable shadcn registries.

| `66ed209c` | feat(engine): add design ci research v2 and token intelligence |

### Key Design Decisions
- **Lead with code-native Design CI** — Memoire now starts from the app developers already have, then moves into registry publishing once the system has been diagnosed and improved.
- **Make research decision-grade, not experimental** — Research V2 uses auditable observations, descriptive quantitative metrics, quality scoring, and explicit methods/caveats instead of untraceable insight blobs.
- **Treat token extraction as an audit surface** — Token extraction now reports semantic coverage, mode parity, alias graph health, duplicates, recommendations, and inferred literals before saving anything as canonical.
- **Keep one-shot CLI commands process-safe** — Background agent timers are unref'ed so extraction and diagnosis commands exit cleanly after writing their artifacts.

### New
- **Design CI diagnosis command** — `memi diagnose [target]` audits real shadcn/Tailwind apps from source code or a URL, scores UI debt, and writes `.memoire/app-quality/diagnosis.{json,md}`.
- **Code-first token intelligence** — `memi tokens --from <file|dir|url>` extracts CSS variables, Tailwind `@theme` tokens, modes, aliases, repeated literals, utility patterns, semantic coverage, mode coverage, duplicate groups, and recommendations.
- **Auditable token reports** — `memi tokens --from ./src --report` writes `token-extraction.report.md` and `token-extraction.report.json` alongside CSS, Tailwind, JSON, and Style Dictionary exports.
- **Featured registry catalog** — `examples/featured-registries.json` now ships a machine-readable fallback list for the website with three first-party showcases: `starter-saas`, `docs-blog`, and `dashboard`.
- **Three first-party showcase registries** — `examples/presets/starter-saas`, `docs-blog`, and `dashboard` give new users installable packages with screenshots, install commands, and source links instead of an empty marketplace story.
- **Growth docs pack** — new `docs/README.md`, `docs/DEMOS.md`, and `docs/LAUNCH.md` define the quickstart, demo scripts, and distribution copy around the registry-first pitch.
- **README proof upgrades** — the package README now leads with two 60-second quickstarts, embeds the theme workflow poster, links to featured registries, and keeps MCP framed as an advanced layer instead of the main story.
- **Release guard for featured content** — `scripts/check-release.mjs` now validates that the featured registry catalog exists, carries at least three entries, and points at real source folders and screenshots.

### Fixed
- `memi tokens --from ... --json` and other initialized one-shot commands now exit cleanly instead of being held open by agent health timers.
- Tightened npm metadata, CLI help text, and first-run messaging to the same installable-registry story.
- Bumped every shipped example registry and starter README marker to `v0.12.4` so release checks stay green.

### Research
- **Richer insight model** — research artifacts now persist categories, sentiment, entities, signal tags, actors, source types, and supporting source links instead of only plain findings and tags.
- **Deeper ingestion** — spreadsheet imports now emit row-level insights, repeated-signal synthesis, participant coverage, and rating summaries; transcript and web imports now preserve structured metadata for downstream synthesis.
- **Decision-ready synthesis** — `memi research synthesize` now generates opportunities, risks, contradictions, personas, and an executive summary on top of themes.
- **Upgraded reporting + preview** — research reports now include executive summary, coverage, opportunities, risks, contradictions, personas, and next moves; the preview dashboard surfaces the same summary layer.

## v0.12.3 — 2026-04-16 (Release hardening)

### The fix
This release closes the remaining gaps between the repo, shipped artifacts, and release automation so the next tag can publish cleanly without hidden version drift.

### New
- **Expanded release guard** — `scripts/check-release.mjs` now validates the shipped plugin bundle metadata, all example registries under `examples/`, the starter preset README version marker, and the synced preview changelog output.
- **Release checks in more pipelines** — CI and release-binary workflows now run `npm run check:release`, so drift gets caught before tags or binaries are built.
- **Linux-safe workflow installs** — publish, CI, and release-binary workflows regenerate `package-lock.json` on the runner before `npm install --ignore-scripts`, which restores the platform-native esbuild binaries needed for Ubuntu test and release jobs.
- **First-class tweakcn workflow** — `memi theme import`, `preview`, `validate`, `diff`, `apply`, `variants`, and `publish` turn tweakcn themes into saved Memoire assets under `.memoire/themes/` instead of a one-off publish flag.
- **Theme validation + semantic diffing** — imported themes now get contrast-aware validation summaries, dark-mode coverage checks, and semantic diff highlights like `primary changed`, `radius scale changed`, and `contrast regressed`.
- **Theme packaging artifacts** — `memi theme publish` now adds `theme.json` metadata and a generated `preview/theme-preview.html` so published theme packages carry more than raw tokens.

### Fixed
- Aligned `examples/starter-registry/registry.json` to the current Memoire release instead of leaving it pinned to `0.11.0`.
- Rebuilt derived release artifacts so `plugin/widget-meta.json` and `preview/changelog.html` reflect `v0.12.3`.

---

## v0.12.2 — 2026-04-15 (Trust + positioning fixes)

### The fix
This release tightens Memoire's public story around the registry workflow and removes the stale version drift that was eroding trust across the repo.

### New
- **Registry-first positioning** across `package.json`, the CLI help text, first-run banner, Homebrew description, and README hero. The public surface now leads with `publish -> add -> design-doc` instead of the full legacy command spread.
- **Release consistency check** via `scripts/check-release.mjs` and `npm run check:release`. It validates that `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the example preset registries all agree on the shipped Memoire version.
- **Publish workflow guard** — `.github/workflows/publish.yml` now runs `npm run check:release` before linting and publishing so version drift fails early.

### Fixed
- Removed stale version examples from install and upgrade docs (`v0.11.0`) and replaced them with generic tagged examples.
- Aligned the example preset registries and starter preset README to `v0.12.2` instead of the incorrect `v0.13.0`.
- Removed hardcoded test/tool counts from key public docs where they had already drifted out of sync.
- Updated deprecation warnings so they no longer claim removal in the already-passed `v0.12.0`.

## v0.12.1 — 2026-04-15 (Marketplace wiring)

### The hook
The CLI now knows about `memoire.cv/components` — Memoire's upcoming Marketplace — and wires both ends of the registry loop to it.

### New
- **`memi view <Component>`** — opens the component's Marketplace page in the system browser. Accepts a bare name (`memi view Button`), a fully-qualified ref (`memi view @acme/ds/Button`), or `--from @acme/ds`. Supports `--print` (stdout only) and `--json` (structured output, no browser).
- **`memi publish` success message** now surfaces the Marketplace URLs where the registry and each component will appear after `npm publish` finishes — making the "what happens next" explicit.
- **Provenance tracking** — `memi add` now stamps `__memoireSource: { registry, version, installedAt }` onto the installed spec. This lets `memi view <Component>` resolve the right Marketplace URL from a bare name. Field is optional; existing specs continue to load.
- **`MARKETPLACE_BASE_URL` constant** in `src/registry/constants.ts`, overridable via `MEMOIRE_MARKETPLACE_URL` env var for dev/staging.
- **9 new tests** across `view.test.ts` (ref parsing, URL assembly, `--from`, local-spec resolution, `--json`) and `publish-message.test.ts` (success-message Marketplace lines). 806 total (up from 797).

### Flow
```bash
# Install a component from a registry
memi add Button --from @acme/ds

# See it on the Marketplace
memi view Button                          # opens memoire.cv/components/@acme/ds/Button
memi view @acme/ds/Card --print           # stdout only
memi view Button --json                   # { url, component, registry }
```

---

## v0.12.0 — 2026-04-15 (tweakcn integration)

### The hook
[tweakcn](https://tweakcn.com) owns visual theming for shadcn/ui. Memoire owns distribution. They now plug into each other.

### New
- **`memi publish --theme <path-or-url>`** — load tokens from a tweakcn CSS export (file or share URL) before publishing. Parses Tailwind v3 `:root { --primary: ... }` **and** v4 `@theme { --color-primary: ... }` blocks, merges `:root` + `.dark` into multi-mode tokens, and hands them to the registry publisher.
- **`src/integrations/tweakcn.ts`** — `parseTweakcnCss()` + `fetchTweakcnTheme()` with the same SSRF guard as the registry resolver.
- **24 new parser tests** covering v3 shorthand HSL, v4 oklch(), dark mode, shadow/spacing/typography classification, and SSRF edge cases.

### Flow
```bash
# Design your theme at tweakcn.com, copy the CSS (or share URL), then:
memi publish --name @you/theme --theme ./tweakcn.css --push

# Any project can now install it:
npx @memi-design/cli add Button --from @you/theme
```

---

## v0.11.0 — 2026-04-15 (The Registry Pivot)

### The shift
Memoire is no longer a "design system extractor." It's a **registry protocol** — the shadcn pattern, for entire design systems. Every Figma file can now be published to npm and installed anywhere as *real working code*, not just specs.

### New commands
- **`memi publish --name @you/ds [--push]`** — Figma → npm package with registry.json + tokens + specs + **bundled React/Vue/Svelte code**. `--push` runs `npm publish --access public` automatically.
- **`memi add <Component> --from <registry>`** — drops a working component file into `src/components/memoire/` immediately (uses bundled code — no local codegen required).
- **`memi update <registry>`** — re-install every component from a registry at its latest version.
- **`memi sync --auto-pr`** — on design system change, create a branch, commit, push, and open a PR via `gh`. The career-ops moment.
- **`memi init <name>`** — scaffold a registry package with your current design system.
- **`memi design-doc <url> --codegen`** — also emit Tailwind v4 `@theme` block.
- **`memi design-doc <url> --init <name>`** — extract URL + immediately build a registry package.

### New modules
- `src/registry/schema.ts` — Memoire Registry Protocol v1 (Zod schemas)
- `src/registry/publisher.ts` — design system → publishable package
- `src/registry/resolver.ts` — fetch registries from npm, github:, https://, local path (with SSRF guard)
- `src/registry/installer.ts` — install components from registries into user projects
- `src/codegen/tailwind-v4.ts` — Tailwind v4 `@theme` CSS generator

### Deprecations (removing in v0.12.0)
`memi heartbeat`, `memi prototype`, `memi dashboard`, `memi list`, `memi research`, `memi ia` now emit deprecation warnings. Silence with `MEMOIRE_SILENCE_DEPRECATIONS=1`.

### Standalone binaries — install without npm
Mémoire now ships as a single executable per OS (`memi-darwin-arm64`, `memi-darwin-x64`, `memi-linux-x64`, `memi-win-x64`) via GitHub Releases. Fixes the top user complaint from locked-down work laptops — no Node, no npm, no admin rights.

**Install channels:**
- `curl -fsSL https://memoire.cv/install.sh | sh` — auto-patches shell rc, verifies SHA256
- `irm https://memoire.cv/install.ps1 | iex` — auto-adds to Windows user PATH
- `brew install sarveshsea/memoire/memoire` — Homebrew tap, auto-updated per release
- `docker run ghcr.io/sarveshsea/memoire` — air-gapped envs
- Manual archive + `SHA256SUMS.txt` download for proxy-blocked users

**New commands:**
- `memi upgrade` — self-update the binary in place (SHA-verified, atomic swap with rollback on failure)

**Under the hood:**
- Built with `bun build --compile` per [scripts/build-binary.mjs](scripts/build-binary.mjs), emitting per-archive `.sha256` and combined `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- CI matrix in [.github/workflows/release-binaries.yml](.github/workflows/release-binaries.yml) produces 4 archives + Docker image + Homebrew formula bump per tag
- New [src/utils/asset-path.ts](src/utils/asset-path.ts) resolves sidecar assets (`skills/`, `notes/`, `plugin/`, `preview/templates/`) in both npm and binary modes
- `@napi-rs/canvas` moved to `optionalDependencies` with a character-width fallback so text measurement works even when the native module isn't available
- First-run welcome banner in [src/index.ts](src/index.ts) shown once per `$HOME`, stamped so it never nags

### Tests
20+ new tests across registry schema, publisher round-trip, and resolver SSRF guards.

---

## v0.10.1 — 2026-04-13 (Architecture + Growth)

### Highlights
- **Multi-framework codegen** — `memi generate --framework vue|svelte` alongside React
- **AI retry logic** — exponential backoff (3 retries) for transient API failures
- **Token-aware codegen** — generated components use CSS variable refs instead of hardcoded hex
- **`memi diff`** — show what changed since last design system pull
- **Parallel pipeline** — spec generation and registry loading run concurrently
- **REST pull MCP tool** — `pull_design_system_rest` (21 tools total)
- **JSDoc + a11y defaults** — generated components include purpose docs and ARIA attributes
- **39 new tests** — auto-spec, page-gen, dataviz-gen, tailwind-tokens, AI retry, Penpot SSRF
- **Glama A A A** — MCP server listed on Glama with full quality score

### Security & Stability
- Configurable `--timeout` for design-doc fetch
- Prop name validation (TS identifier check) in MCP `create_spec`
- Atom composition now an error (not warning) in spec validation
- `.npmignore` — package 60% smaller, no src/tests/Dockerfile shipped

### Distribution
- awesome-mcp-servers PR submitted (Glama badge, A A A)
- awesome-claude-code issue filed
- README rewritten for viral positioning
- design-extract skill + registry entry

## v0.10.0 — 2026-04-10 (Growth Sprint)

### Commits
| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `666fbfb` | feat: security hardening, Storybook generation, package keywords |
| `f198be1` | feat: Style Dictionary export, shadcn registry server, Penpot bridge |
| `e863f4e` | feat: zero-friction path — npx extract, memi extract alias, DESIGN.md attribution |

### New Features

**Penpot bridge (`memi pull --penpot`)** — Full Penpot REST API integration. Pulls colors, typographies, and design tokens from any Penpot file using `PENPOT_TOKEN` + `PENPOT_FILE_ID` + `PENPOT_BASE_URL`. No plugin required, no browser needed. Returns the same `DesignSystem` interface so all downstream codegen works unchanged.

**Style Dictionary export** — `memi tokens` now emits `tokens.style-dictionary.json` in W3C DTCG format (`$type`/`$value` syntax). Plugs Mémoire into the 200K weekly Style Dictionary ecosystem — Figma → tokens → Style Dictionary → any platform.

**shadcn registry server** — The local preview server (`memi preview`) now serves a `/r/` registry endpoint compatible with shadcn v2. Any generated component is installable via `npx shadcn add http://localhost:3030/r/ComponentName.json` without publishing to npm.

**Storybook CSF3 story generation** — Every `memi generate` now produces a `.stories.tsx` alongside the component and barrel. Default + per-variant stories, autodocs enabled, `Meta<typeof Comp>` typed. Taps into the 4.6M weekly Storybook ecosystem.

**`memi design-doc` / `memi extract`** — `memi extract <url>` alias works. DESIGN.md output includes attribution footer. Hostname sanitization strips unicode/special chars safely.

**Component fingerprints** — Every generated component carries `// Generated by Memoire · memi generate <name> · https://memoire.cv` as its first line, making AI tools and grep trivially identify Mémoire-managed files.

**CLAUDE.md + .mcp.json injection on `memi init`** — Every initialized project gets a `CLAUDE.md` listing all 20 MCP tools and a `.mcp.json` with the Mémoire server config. Claude Code picks it up automatically every session.

**`llms.txt` on memoire.cv** — Machine-readable AI discovery file. Codex, Claude, and other LLM tools that crawl `llms.txt` will find Mémoire and understand when to suggest it.

### Security Fixes (11)
1. Path traversal guard in preview static serving (`resolve` alias prevents escaping `staticDir`)
2. Prototype pollution block in `registry.ts` JSON.parse reviver (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` keys filtered)
3. SSRF guard for CSS `@import` URLs in `css-extractor.ts` (validates resolved URLs against `assertPublicUrl`)
4. WebSocket origin validation in `api-server.ts` (localhost-only `verifyClient` callback)
5. CORS scoping to exact port in `/api/` routes (was wildcard)
6. CORS scoping to localhost in `/r/` registry routes
7. Component name validation in registry routes (`/^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_-]*$/`)
8. Combined rate-limit score in `ws-server.ts` (message + byte weights, not separate counters)
9. `redirect: "error"` on Penpot fetch to prevent auth token leakage via SSRF
10. Hostname sanitization in `design-doc.ts` (strips unicode, collapses hyphens, 60-char cap)
11. Path traversal in spec file writes blocked by `assertWithinDir` in `registry.ts`

### New Features

**`memi setup` — zero-friction onboarding**
Single command that handles the full Figma + Claude Code setup. Validates token via REST immediately (shows `@handle` and email on paste — no more waiting until `memi pull` to find out the token was wrong). Validates file key. Checks plugin health and auto-reinstalls if stale. Copies manifest path to clipboard on macOS. Starts bridge in background. Writes `.mcp.json` automatically. Runs a test pull to confirm the full chain. Prints a ready summary. Collapses the typical 2-hour debugging session into a 5-minute guided flow.

**Instant token validation in `memi connect`**
`GET /v1/me` is called the moment a token is pasted. Shows `@handle (email)` immediately. `401` surfaces a clear message pointing to `figma.com/settings` instead of surfacing as a cryptic error 10 minutes later during pull.

**`memi connect --background`**
Spawns a detached bridge process and exits immediately — no terminal tab required to keep the bridge alive. Polls `bridge.json` for up to 8 seconds and confirms the port before exiting.

**`memi pull` auto REST fallback**
When no bridge is running and `FIGMA_TOKEN` + `FIGMA_FILE_KEY` are available, `memi pull` falls back to the REST API automatically — no `--rest` flag needed, no waiting for a plugin timeout. Also falls back after a plugin timeout. Prints a tip to run `memi connect --background` for real-time sync.

**`memi mcp config --install`**
Writes the MCP config directly to the target file instead of printing JSON to copy manually. `--install` writes to `.mcp.json` in the project root. `--install --global` writes to `~/.claude/settings.json`. Merges safely into existing config without overwriting other `mcpServers` entries.

**`docker-environments` Note**
New `connect` category Note covering Docker-aware Mémoire operation: Figma bridge port-forwarding topology, CI/CD headless WCAG + spec pipelines, shared MCP server as a team service, agent workers as isolated containers, and devcontainer setup. Auto-activates when `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, or `.devcontainer/` is detected in the project root.

**Blueprint 1 — `design-doc` contrast report**
`parseCSSTokens` now returns a `contrastPairs` field with every extracted color checked against white and black. `memi design-doc` prints a failure summary in the terminal and adds a `## Contrast` section to DESIGN.md. The `--wcag` flag dumps the full table for all pairs, not just failures.

**Blueprint 2 — Zod WCAG spec validators**
`touchTarget` now validates against the WCAG 2.5.8 24×24px minimum with a descriptive error message. `focusWidth` (min 2px) and `focusContrastRatio` (min 3:1) enforce WCAG 2.4.11. A new optional `colorContrast` block documents AA/AAA intent on every component spec. The spec command formats Zod errors as aligned `[field]  message` columns.

**Blueprint 3 — `memi audit --wcag`**
New dedicated audit command. Runs 5 checks per spec (contrast, aria, keyboard, touch, focus), emits WCAG criterion codes (1.4.3, 4.1.2, 2.1.1, 2.5.8, 2.4.11) in `--json` output, and exits non-zero on failures. `--component <name>` for CI targeting.

**Blueprint 4 — `pull --wcag`**
Post-pull WCAG report on the design system. `src/figma/wcag-token-checker.ts` checks color tokens (contrast vs white, matching WebAIM semantics) and spacing tokens (24px minimum). Exit code 2 on failures. `auditDesignSystemWcag()` method on `MemoireEngine` for MCP/agent use.

**Blueprint 5 — Preview gallery landmarks**
`<header>`, `<nav aria-label>`, `<main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">`, `<footer>`, heading hierarchy (h1→h2), skip-to-content link, `aria-live="polite"` on status region, `:focus-visible` global focus style. Also fixed a bug where `${CSS}` was escaped (`\${CSS}`) in the template literal, preventing the stylesheet from being injected.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Contrast vs white, not max-against-extremes** — `auditTokensForWcag` uses contrast against white as the check surface. `maxContrastAgainstExtremes` (taking the best of white/black) always returns ≥4.58 for any color, making warn/fail unreachable. The vs-white approach matches WebAIM and reflects real-world foreground-on-white usage.

- **Warn tier uses #787878, not #767676** — WCAG precision differences between tools: our formula gives #767676 a 4.54:1 vs white (pass), while WebAIM reports 4.48. Using #787878 (4.42:1) gives unambiguous test coverage for the warn tier without fighting floating-point rounding.

- **Exit code 2 for WCAG failures** — `pull --wcag` sets exit code 2 (not 1) on WCAG violations. Exit code 1 is infrastructure error (can't connect, can't write). This lets CI pipelines distinguish "tool failed" from "design system has accessibility debt".

- **`colorContrast` is declarative, not enforced** — The spec schema field documents intent; `memi audit --wcag` enforces it. Separating declaration from enforcement means teams can adopt incrementally without breaking existing spec creation.

### New Features

**`memi pull --rest` — Plugin-free Figma pull**

Pulls your design system directly from the Figma REST API. No Figma Desktop, no WebSocket plugin, no bridge. Set `FIGMA_TOKEN` and `FIGMA_FILE_KEY` in `.env.local` and run:

```bash
memi pull --rest
memi pull --rest --force   # bypass 5-minute cache
memi go --rest             # full pipeline in REST mode
```

Calls `/v1/files/:key/variables/local`, `/components`, and `/styles` in parallel. Partial failures (one endpoint down) log a warning and continue — the pull recovers whatever data it can. `FigmaConfigError` (403/404) always propagates so you get a clear error instead of silent empty data.

**`memi design-doc <url>` — Extract design system from any URL**

Fetches any public URL, parses all linked CSS (following one level of `@import`), and produces a `DESIGN.md` ready to use as AI prompt context:

```bash
memi design-doc https://linear.app
memi design-doc https://vercel.com --output VERCEL_DESIGN.md
memi design-doc https://stripe.com --spec   # also writes specs/design-stripe-com.json
```

Extracts: CSS custom properties, color palette (capped at 50 to filter noise), font families, font sizes, spacing values, border radii, box shadows. With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, Claude synthesizes a structured `DESIGN.md` with semantic token naming, Tailwind config sketch, and Do/Don't rules. Without it, generates a raw extraction table.

Also available as MCP tool `design_doc` for Claude Code / Cursor integration.

### Key Design Decisions

- **REST Pull Architecture** — `src/figma/rest-client.ts` mirrors `bridge.extractDesignSystem()` exactly, returning the same `DesignSystem` interface. Zero changes to registry, autoSpec, or codegen — they consume REST-pulled data identically to plugin-pulled data.

- **FigmaConfigError propagation** — 403/404/5xx from Figma REST are re-thrown as `FigmaConfigError` (now exported). Network failures and timeouts are absorbed (warn-logged, partial recovery). This makes config problems loud and transient problems silent.

- **CSS @import following** — `fetchPageAssets()` follows one level of `@import url()` and `@import "..."` in linked stylesheets, then stops. Prevents infinite loops on circular imports while capturing the token layer most design systems put in a separate file.

- **Color noise cap** — `MAX_COLORS = 50` prevents icon-heavy sites (hundreds of inline SVG colors) from drowning out the actual palette. Applied after deduplication.

- **Doctor REST check** — `memi doctor` now verifies `FIGMA_TOKEN` + `FIGMA_FILE_KEY` presence and reports three states: both set (pass), token only (warn), neither (warn). The check code is `rest.credentials`.

- **Test-driven bug discovery** — 178 new tests across 4 files found 2 real bugs before release: (1) `FigmaConfigError` was silently absorbed instead of propagating, making 403/404 indistinguishable from success; (2) `design-doc --output /absolute/path` double-prefixed the path with `projectRoot`. Both fixed before tagging.

| `d16f4e6` | Remove Framer preview components and standalone build script |
| `1cb0ae9` | Bump to v0.7.0 — the compression release |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Template Extraction** — HTML/CSS/JS content extracted from TypeScript template literals into static asset files. Gallery page (3,762→2,044 lines) and research page (730→208 lines) now load CSS and client JS via `readFileSync` at module init. Build pipeline updated to copy assets to `dist/`.

- **Data-Driven Components** — shadcn-library.ts reduced from 1,540 to 850 lines by deleting 20 dead `My*()` functions and replacing verbose object literals with a `comp()` factory + compact variant tuples. Component catalog reduced from 723 to 114 lines by moving data to JSON.

- **Orchestrator Decomposition** — The 2,208-line monolithic orchestrator split into four focused modules: `intent-classifier.ts` (pattern matching), `plan-builder.ts` (task decomposition), `sub-agents.ts` (heuristic execution), and a thin `orchestrator.ts` coordinator (535 lines). Each module is independently testable.

- **Test Deduplication** — Shared `test-helpers.ts` module eliminates `captureLogs`/`lastLog`/`writePluginBundle` duplication across 14 test files.

- **Exponential Backoff** — Figma WebSocket reconnection uses exponential backoff (100ms → 5s) with ±25% jitter instead of flat delays.

- **Pull Caching** — `pullDesignSystem()` caches results for 5 minutes. Prevents duplicate API calls from CLI retries or agent loops.

- **Codegen Caching** — SHA-256 hash of spec + design system skips code generation when nothing changed. Massively faster iterative workflows.

- **Batch Orchestration** — `executeBatch(intents[])` reuses a single context across multiple design intents for throughput.

- **Daemon Instrumentation** — Phase timings (init, figma-connect, preview-start, ready) in daemon status output.

- **Generate Preview** — `memi generate <spec> --preview` outputs generated code without writing to disk.

- **New MCP Tools** — `sync_design_tokens` (Figma → Tailwind config), `get_ai_usage` (session cost), `check_bridge_health` (latency diagnostics).

- **Persistent Task Queue** — JSON-backed persistence for agent tasks survives daemon restarts.

## v0.6.0 — 2026-03-30

### Commits
| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `e2bbdd5` | Add Framer preview components and standalone dashboard build script |
| `3a6ce0d` | Audit fixes: memory leaks, race conditions, error handling across 10 files |
| `24f067c` | Efficiency fixes: incremental TS build, rate limiter stale entry eviction |
| `2d87916` | Remove dead dependencies and unused TUI app file |
| `dd4bd77` | Add research preview tab — insights, personas, themes, coverage bar in dashboard |
| `b152460` | Add research traceability — bidirectional insight-to-spec links |
| `bcb437a` | Add transcript processor — heuristic interview parsing into structured research |
| `7bc6aef` | Add pull diff output — show token/component/style changes after pull |
| `3390192` | Add memi validate command — expose spec validator as CLI tool |
| `dcac4a7` | Add capability matrix — every command declares what it needs |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Capability Matrix** — Every command declares required and optional capabilities (figma, ai, specs, generated-code, research, daemon). Missing required capabilities produce recovery-oriented error messages. Missing optional capabilities trigger degraded mode with warnings. This enables offline-first workflows and clear "what to do next" guidance.

- **Spec Validation CLI** — `memi validate` exposes the existing Zod schema validator + cross-reference checker as a CLI tool. Checks atomic design hierarchy, prop explosion, Code Connect mapping, and spec-to-spec references. Exit code 1 on errors for CI integration.

- **Pull Diff** — `memi pull` now snapshots the design system before pulling and shows a structured diff after: added/modified/removed tokens, components, and styles. Designers can see exactly what changed before generating code.

- **Transcript Processor** — Heuristic-first interview parsing with 4 speaker detection patterns, TF-IDF theme extraction (150+ stop words), first-person quote detection, and per-segment sentiment analysis. Generates ResearchInsight objects automatically from negative/positive themes. AI enhances but never gates.

- **Research Traceability** — Bidirectional reverse index between insights and specs. `getSpecsForInsight()` for impact analysis, `getInsightsForSpec()` for provenance, `getOrphanedInsights()` for cleanup, `getCoverage()` for reporting. Persisted to `.memoire/research/spec-index.json`.

- **Research Preview Tab** — Dashboard now has a Research panel showing insights, personas, themes, and a coverage bar (% of specs backed by research). Lazy-loaded on toggle. API endpoint upgraded with coverage stats.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-03-30

### Commits
| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `ba3e637` | Implement real heuristic fallbacks in 5 stubbed agents |
| `dc04f42` | Add research-to-design mapping — insights drive spec requirements |
| `59245d9` | Upgrade codegen — variant logic, smart component bodies, page prop drilling |
| `ca9ba2c` | Add real accessibility enforcement — WCAG contrast computation, spec auditing |
| `0064999` | Add AI vision for design QA — multimodal analysis of Figma screenshots |

### Key Design Decisions

- **AI Vision (analyze_design MCP tool)** — Claude's multimodal capability is now available for design QA. The AnthropicClient supports image content blocks (base64 PNG/JPEG). DesignAnalyzer provides 3 modes: general quality analysis (0-100 score), WCAG accessibility audit, and spec compliance checking. All return structured VisualIssue arrays with severity, category, location, and fix suggestions.

- **Real WCAG Enforcement** — The AccessibilityChecker computes actual WCAG 2.2 contrast ratios from hex token values (relative luminance + contrast ratio formula). It validates AA/AAA/AA-Large thresholds, checks semantic token completeness (focus ring, error, disabled), and audits component specs for ariaLabel, keyboardNav, focusStyle, and touchTarget. runFullAudit() produces a 0-100 score with WCAG level determination.

- **Smart Component Bodies** — Code generation now produces variant-aware components. buildVariantLogic() generates a variant → Tailwind class mapping (20 presets: primary, outline, ghost, compact, success, warning, etc.). New component builders for Button (variant prop + disabled + icon), Input (Label + error message), Avatar (image + fallback initials), and Dialog (trigger + header + content). Page generator now derives data props from section configurations for dynamic pages.

- **Research → Design Mapping** — 12 keyword rules map research insights to typed SpecRequirements (accessibility, ux, interaction, content, performance). Insights target specific specs by name mention, tag overlap, or rule patterns. generateA11yChecklist() builds prioritized [MUST]/[SHOULD]/[COULD] checklists. mapPersonaRequirements() extracts requirements from persona pain points.

- **Agent Intelligence Layer** — All 5 stubbed agents now have real heuristic logic. Token-engineer parses hex colors and numeric values from prompts to create/update tokens. Design-auditor runs full WCAG audit + research coverage analysis. Accessibility-checker computes pairwise contrast failures. Theme-builder generates semantic palettes from a base color (6 derived tokens + 6 semantic defaults). Responsive-specialist validates grid layouts, component variants, and touch targets.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-03-30

### Commits
| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `7639909` | Add multi-Claude native orchestration — agent registry, task queue, agent bridge |
| `9583c4d` | Add bidirectional design-code sync — token differ, sync engine, code watcher |
| `2f25eef` | Add event-driven pipeline to daemon — reactive pull/diff/spec/generate |
| `fea3b14` | Add MCP server — expose Memoire as design infrastructure for any AI tool |
| `e679df4` | Clean up: log silent catches, remove dead params, rebuild plugin bundle |
| `dfc1243` | Add missing WCAG 2.2 accessibility fields to spec scaffolds |
| `a96976e` | Fix preview dashboard: XSS escaping, CORS lockdown, body limits, broken JSX |
| `9d857fb` | Audit fixes: ReDoS guard, token validation, timer cleanup, XSS escape |

### Key Design Decisions

- **MCP Server (Phase 1)** — Memoire exposes 14 tools and 3 resources via the Model Context Protocol, making it callable by Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible AI. Stdout logging is suppressed in MCP mode to prevent interference with the JSON-RPC stdio transport.

- **Event-Driven Pipeline (Phase 2)** — The daemon upgrades from a keepalive loop to a reactive automation system. Figma document changes flow through: pull -> diff snapshot -> auto-spec if components changed -> auto-generate if specs changed. The pipeline listens to engine event emissions (not raw document-changed) to avoid double-pulling.

- **Bidirectional Sync (Phase 3)** — Closes the design-code loop. A token differ (SHA-256 entity hashing) tracks per-entity state on both the Figma and code sides. Conflict detection uses a configurable time window (default 1s) — when both sides change the same entity simultaneously, it's logged as a conflict for manual resolution. The sync guard prevents echo loops during push operations.

- **Multi-Claude Orchestration (Phase 4)** — Multiple Claude instances can now operate as persistent agents, each owning a role (token-engineer, component-architect, etc.). The AgentRegistry manages lifecycle with file-based persistence and 30s heartbeat eviction. The TaskQueue provides distributed task claiming with dependency resolution and timeout reclamation. The orchestrator's `tryExternalOrInternal` dispatches to external agents first and falls back to internal execution.

- **Registry as EventEmitter** — The Registry now extends EventEmitter and emits `token-changed`, `spec-changed`, and `design-system-changed` events, enabling the sync system and pipeline to react to mutations without polling.

### Key Design Decisions
- **Notes Become a Real Extension Surface** — Mémoire now treats Notes as installable skill packs, including workspace `SKILL.md` bundles, built-in notes, and compatibility fixes for activation and copy behavior.
- **Composable Agent Workflows** — Compose now resolves a concrete target spec before codegen, and the orchestrator no longer silently regenerates the full spec set for creation intents.
- **Machine-Friendly CLI Surfaces** — `status`, `notes list`, and `notes info` can emit clean JSON, which makes the CLI more usable for Codex, Claude, and other automation.
- **Fast Local Build Loop** — dedicated build config and build script reduce warm build latency and stop shipping unnecessary sourcemap artifacts during normal iteration.
- **Codex-Oriented Operating Guidance** — built-in notes now include Codex ops guidance, and core inventory commands expose more JSON so agent workflows can inspect specs and IA state without scraping prose.
- **Research Pipeline Becomes Scriptable** — research import, synthesis, and report commands now expose artifact paths and summaries in JSON, so automation can chain them without terminal scraping.
- **Workspace State Is Less Noisy** — generated atomic output and preview build artifacts are now treated as workspace state in git ignore rules, reducing irrelevant status noise during agent work.
- **Daemon Health Becomes Queryable** — `memi daemon status --json` now reports runtime ports, preview URL, uptime, Figma connection state, and stale-cleanup results so agents can check background state without parsing terminal prose.
- **Connect Setup Becomes Queryable** — `memi connect --json` now reports token/file-key discovery, plugin manifest resolution, bridge startup state, and next steps without dropping into prompts.
- **Onboarding Stops Rewriting Existing Workspace State** — `init` now preserves existing starter specs, project-context persistence keeps stable timestamps when nothing changed, and prototype output defaults under `.memoire/` instead of tracked source folders.
- **Runtime and Bridge Hardening** — Preview, the Figma bridge, signal handling, and listener management were tightened so bind failures and cleanup paths surface clearly.
- **Modern Project Detection and Packaging** — Tailwind v4, shadcn, plugin manifest access, postinstall behavior, and npm packaging were hardened for current app layouts.
- **Plugin Bundles Become Generated Artifacts** — The Figma widget source now lives under `src/plugin/` as typed main/UI/shared modules, while `plugin/code.js` and `plugin/ui.html` remain checked-in build outputs for npm packaging and postinstall copy.
- **Bridge Compatibility Becomes an Explicit Adapter** — The plugin UI, plugin main thread, and bridge server now share typed bridge envelopes in code while preserving the existing legacy WebSocket wire format for `command`, `response`, and passive bridge events.
- **Operator Console Optimizes for Triage** — The plugin panel now treats jobs and selected nodes as operational surfaces, with presenter-driven summaries, node quick actions, and richer selection diagnostics above raw logs.
- **Jobs Become Persistent Widget State** — The plugin main thread now owns a real job store, bootstrap can restore existing job state, reconnect downgrades active work explicitly, and sync/healer summaries persist in the operator console instead of vanishing into transient logs.
- **Canvas Agent Widgets Gain Stable Identity** — On-canvas agent boxes are now keyed by `{runId, taskId, role}`, seeded per plan, and updated through real idle/busy/done/error lifecycle transitions instead of overwriting a single role-based box.
- **Preview Gains Widget-Grade State** — The preview API now keeps a live cache of bridge, selection, job, sync, healer, and agent status so dashboards can query the same operational state the Figma widget sees.
- **Widget Bundle Health Becomes Explicit** — The build now emits widget metadata, postinstall records install state, and `connect` / `doctor` report whether the installed Control Plane bundle is built, current, and operator-ready.
- **Figma Imports Must Use a Copied, Runtime-Compatible Bundle** — The shipped widget now targets ES2019, build tests fail on leaked `??` / `?.`, postinstall dereferences the copied plugin bundle, and install health treats symlink-resolved imports as unsafe before Figma rejects them.
- **Figma Runtime Compatibility Is Enforced at an ES2017 Syntax Floor** — The shipped widget bundle now targets ES2017 so raw object spread is compiled away before import, and the build regression test now checks for parser-breaking object spread instead of relying on a broad regex.
- **Widget UI Bootstraps Only After the Mount Node Exists** — The operator console now waits for `DOMContentLoaded` before resolving `#app`, which keeps the inlined bundle from crashing when Vite hoists the script into `<head>`.
- **Preview Changelog Is Now Generated from CHANGELOG.md** — `preview/changelog.html` is no longer hand-synced via an embedded release array; the build regenerates it from `CHANGELOG.md`, and a regression test now fails if the checked-in preview page drifts from the changelog source.
- **Widget Typography Uses Local System Stacks** — The Figma panel no longer depends on remote Google Fonts, so the embedded webview renders with reliable mono and serif system fonts even when external font loads are blocked.
- **Widget Typography Now Carries Real Hierarchy** — The Control Plane now uses serif only for brand/section emphasis, sans for controls and values, and mono for operator metadata so the panel reads like a tool instead of one flat font block.
- **Widget Typography Now Has Real Hierarchy** — The Control Plane uses sans text for readable body and controls, reserves mono for operational metadata, and keeps serif accents only where they add identity, which makes the panel feel deliberate instead of uniformly thin.
- **Widget Density Now Prioritizes Operator Throughput** — The Control Plane opens shorter, collapses internal spacing, and removes artificial empty-state height so the Figma panel shows more state per viewport instead of spending its budget on whitespace.
- **Widget Runtime Avoids Unnecessary Modern APIs** — The shipped plugin now avoids `Object.fromEntries` in the main thread and explicitly switches to a single-column layout when the activity surface is absent, which reduces compatibility risk and prevents hidden-layout width loss.
- **Widget Runtime Now Targets Compatibility-Safe Primitives** — The Control Plane replaces fragile `find`/`findIndex`/`includes`/`padStart` dependencies with shared compatibility helpers, uses a manual DOM-ready listener, and falls back to `execCommand("copy")` when the clipboard API is unavailable.

- Added the Notes ecosystem release, including audit fixes, activation cleanup, recursive-copy handling, and dead-code removal
- Added preview hot reload, doc-change polling, e2e tests, and npm packaging prep
- Added self-healing, Code Connect checks, and file watcher support
- Hardened the preview and Figma bridge stack with better error handling, signal cleanup, and bind diagnostics
- Improved command routing, plugin manifest access, and port/path detection for production use
- Added CLI ergonomics like `--format`, `dash` aliasing, hidden command registration, and JSON output
- Added regression coverage for compose targeting, export destinations, CLI registration, note installation, and packaged note assets
- Added the built-in Figma web capture note and fixed note hook documentation
- Added the built-in Codex ops note for JSON-first CLI usage, commit hygiene, and agent-safe repo workflows
- Improved project detection for Tailwind and shadcn setups and removed noisy logger transport warnings
- Sped up local TypeScript builds with a dedicated build config and restored the working fast-build script
- Added JSON output to `spec list` and IA `list`/`show`/`validate` so agents can inspect architecture state without terminal scraping
- Added JSON output to `notes install`, `notes create`, and `notes remove` so downloadable note workflows can be automated end to end
- Added JSON output to research `from-file`, `from-stickies`, `synthesize`, and `report` with artifact metadata and no human preamble noise in JSON mode
- Ignored generated atomic component folders, `.astro/`, and preview-generated workspace artifacts to reduce git noise during normal operation
- Synced changelog surfaces for the research and workspace-hygiene changes
- Added JSON output to `daemon status` with stale-cleanup reporting, uptime, and preview connection metadata
- Added JSON output to `connect` so automation can inspect setup state and bridge readiness without entering the guided prompt flow
- Made `init` idempotent for starter specs, kept `.memoire/project.json` stable across unchanged inits, and moved default prototype output under `.memoire/prototype`
- Added a dedicated `src/plugin/` TypeScript source tree for the Figma widget, with typed contracts, modular main/UI code, and a dedicated plugin build pipeline
- Rebuilt the shipped plugin bundles from source during `npm run build` and added regression coverage for generated `plugin/code.js` and `plugin/ui.html`
- Synced changelog surfaces for the plugin V2 foundation push
- Normalized the widget and bridge protocol with shared bridge contracts, a UI bridge-command adapter, additive session/run metadata, and legacy-wire compatibility for existing engine flows
- Synced changelog surfaces for the widget bridge protocol push
- Enhanced the operator console with job-overview summaries, per-node quick actions, richer selection state/layout details, and a presenter layer with regression coverage
- Synced changelog surfaces for the operator console workflows push
- Added persistent widget job state, reconnect-safe job degradation, bootstrap job restoration, and durable sync/healer summaries with dedicated regression coverage
- Synced changelog surfaces for the widget job state push
- Rewrote the canvas agent widget lifecycle with stable run/task identity, deterministic ordering, richer box content, and orchestration wiring backed by helper tests
- Added widget-aware preview endpoints for Figma status, jobs, selection, and agents, backed by a dedicated preview state cache and regression coverage
- Upgraded the preview gallery footer into a live control summary and published agent-status updates beyond the canvas so preview and the Control Plane share the same orchestration view
- Added widget build metadata, install metadata, and a new install-health resolver so the Control Plane bundle can be verified programmatically
- Upgraded `connect` and `doctor` to report widget version, bundle readiness, install freshness, and plugin health in both JSON and human-readable output, then aligned README, notes, and multi-agent guidance with the shipped Widget V2 behavior
- Downleveled the shipped Figma widget bundle to ES2019, rebuilt `plugin/code.js` and `plugin/ui.html`, and added regression tests that fail if modern syntax leaks into checked-in plugin assets
- Hardened postinstall to replace `~/.memoire/plugin` with a dereferenced copy, persist resolved install metadata, and warn when the safe copied import path cannot be created
- Expanded symlink-risk detection to catch imports resolved through linked paths, then updated connect and README guidance so users re-import from `~/.memoire/plugin/manifest.json` when Figma rejects a linked manifest
- Lowered the plugin bundle target from ES2019 to ES2017 so Vite compiles raw object spread out of both `plugin/code.js` and `plugin/ui.html`, which fixes the Figma parser failure at `...state.connection`
- Rebuilt the shipped widget artifacts and updated widget metadata after the ES2017 compatibility pass
- Tightened the plugin build regression test so it catches actual object spread in built artifacts without false-flagging safe array spread
- Fixed the blank widget panel by deferring UI bootstrap until `#app` exists, which prevents the inlined `plugin/ui.html` script from throwing before the body is parsed
- Replaced `replaceAll` in the plugin UI escape helpers with regex replacements to avoid another first-render compatibility trap in embedded runtimes
- Added build coverage that asserts the generated widget bundle includes the DOM-ready bootstrap path
- Added `scripts/build-changelog-preview.mjs` to parse `CHANGELOG.md`, normalize release data, and regenerate `preview/changelog.html` from the changelog source of truth
- Wired `npm run build` to refresh the preview changelog automatically and added `npm run build:changelog` for direct regeneration
- Added a regression test that compares the checked-in `preview/changelog.html` against generated output from `CHANGELOG.md`, so stale preview changelog data now fails locally
- Removed Google Fonts dependencies from the Figma widget UI, switched the operator console to local system mono/serif stacks, and added a build regression check so blocked web fonts do not silently ship again
- Strengthened the widget typography hierarchy by enlarging brand and section titles, increasing metric-value emphasis, and using a clearer sans treatment for tabs and operator controls
- Reworked the widget type hierarchy so operator copy and controls use a stronger sans stack, brand and section heads keep serif emphasis, and telemetry labels stay mono instead of flattening the whole panel into one weak font treatment
- Tightened the widget typography pass with a larger base text size, stronger control weights, clearer status pills, and better subtitle/chip readability inside the Figma panel
- Reduced the widget height, tightened panel and card spacing, turned the action row into a denser grid, and cut the operator tab panel minimum so the Figma plugin wastes less vertical space
- Replaced the last `Object.fromEntries` use in the plugin main thread, made the widget content grid collapse to a true single-column layout when logs are hidden, and tightened the build regression test so these compatibility/layout-state regressions fail in CI
- Added shared compatibility helpers for array/string lookup and padding, removed the remaining modern runtime helpers from shipped widget code, added a clipboard fallback path, and expanded plugin regression coverage so those APIs do not leak back into the built bundle

## v0.2.0 — 2026-03-26

### Commits
| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `358c9e3` | Add 4 powerhouse Notes — deep skill packs (4,400+ lines) |
| `dbcb551` | Add Mémoire Notes — downloadable skill pack ecosystem |

### Key Design Decisions
- **Notes as First-Class Extension System** — Mémoire Notes are downloadable skill packs that extend what the engine can do. Each Note is a folder with `note.json` manifest + markdown skill files. Four categories: craft, research, connect, generate.
- **Three-Source Loading** — NoteLoader discovers notes from legacy `skills/registry.json`, built-in `notes/*/note.json` packages, and user-installed `.memoire/notes/`. User-installed override built-in by name.
- **Activation by Intent** — Notes are resolved per classified intent and injected into agent prompts. `activateOn` contexts map to IntentCategory with an 8K character limit for prompt injection.
- **Deep Skill Files** — Four powerhouse Notes ship built-in: self-improving-agent (628 lines), mobile-craft (1,466 lines), design-systems (1,411 lines), competitive-intel (894 lines). Real expertise, not templates.

### Notes System
- Added `src/notes/` module: types (Zod schemas), loader, resolver, installer, index
- Added `src/commands/notes.ts` with 5 CLI subcommands: install, list, remove, create, info
- Integrated NoteLoader into MemoireEngine (`engine.notes`)
- Agent orchestrator resolves and injects Notes per intent classification
- Status command shows Notes count
- Init command creates `.memoire/notes/` directory

### Key Design Decisions
- **Atomic Design Only** — Every generated component must declare an atomic level (atom, molecule, organism, template). Enforced in specs and codegen.
- **MCP Tool Decision Tree** — `use_figma` for design-system-aware ops, `figma_execute` for raw Plugin API. Check Code Connect BEFORE creating anything.
- **Self-Healing Loop** — Mandatory CREATE → SCREENSHOT → ANALYZE → FIX → VERIFY (max 3 rounds) for all canvas operations.
- **Code Connect First-Class** — Every ComponentSpec has a `codeConnect` field mapping Figma node IDs to codebase paths.
- **Multi-Agent Native** — Multiple Claude instances on ports 9223-9232. Color-coded box widgets in Figma (yellow=working, green=done, red=error).
- **AgenticUI Aesthetic** — Monospace terminal-paper aesthetic. Dark for system UI, warm paper for generated output. Gold accent (#9D833E).
- **Skills Architecture** — 10 skill files with freedom levels (maximum, high, read-only, reference).
- **Changelog Convention** — Claude updates this file after every Mémoire commit. User projects are tracked locally in `.memoire/`, not here.
- **Auto-Spec Engine** — `memi pull` automatically creates ComponentSpecs from Figma components. Infers atomic level, shadcn base, and props.
- **Single-Command Pipeline** — `memi go` runs connect → pull → auto-spec → generate → preview in one command.
- **Export to Project** — `memi export` copies generated code into the user's actual project tree.
- **Token-Aware Codegen** — Generated components inject CSS variable references from pulled design tokens.
- **Motion Video Skill** — `/motion-video` superagent for Apple-grade product animation, portfolio videos, motion tokens, Figma→AE pipeline.

### Changes
- Created `src/engine/auto-spec.ts` — auto-spec engine (Figma components → ComponentSpecs)
- Created `src/commands/go.ts` — single-command full pipeline
- Created `src/commands/export.ts` — export generated code to user project

- Created `preview/changelog.html` — timeline view with design decisions per version
- Upgraded all 9 skills against Figma MCP best practices
- Created 3 new skills: `DASHBOARD_FROM_RESEARCH.md`, `FIGMA_AUDIT.md`, `FIGMA_PROTOTYPE.md`
- Added animated 3D moon SVG to README header
- Complete ark → noche rename across 40+ files
- Updated `skills/registry.json` to v2.0.0
