/**
 * Skill Compliance Checker — post-hoc, deterministic verification that real
 * source files follow the checkable rules described in skills/ATOMIC_DESIGN.md
 * and skills/MOTION_VIDEO_DESIGN.md.
 *
 * No LLM reads these docs at check time — the checkable rules are hand-extracted
 * into the regex/string checks below (each cites the doc line it came from), so
 * this stays fast and deterministic like specs/validator.ts. This does not make
 * an agent obey markdown — it is the same mechanism a linter uses to enforce a
 * style guide: run after the fact, over real files, independent of whether the
 * agent read the doc, generated the file via memi, or hand-wrote it.
 *
 * skills/DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md contributes nothing checkable — it is a
 * pure component-name-to-external-URL catalog with zero required props, states,
 * durations, or naming rules. getReferenceCoverage() below surfaces it as a
 * read-only benchmark annotation, never a pass/fail input.
